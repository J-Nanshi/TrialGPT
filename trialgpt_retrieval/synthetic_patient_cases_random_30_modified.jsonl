Her other laboratory tests were also within acceptable ranges, including hemoglobin at 110 g/L, platelet count of 180x10^9/L, and an absolute neutrophil count of 2.5x10^9/L. Sarah's overall health was good, with an expected survival time of more than 6 months. She had no history of severe acute or chronic diseases, diabetes, or serious infectious diseases. Sarah was not pregnant or lactating, and she had no issues with oral medication intake. She did not have any active bleeding, HIV infection, or AIDS-associated diseases. Sarah also had no history of drug abuse or psychological or mental health issues that could interfere with study compliance."}
{"_id": "P_NCT03090165", "text": "Lucy, a 74-year-old woman, was diagnosed with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) two years ago. She had undergone two lines of systemic therapy for her metastatic disease, but her cancer continued to progress. Recent immunohistochemistry testing revealed that her tumor was androgen receptor (AR) positive, with 15% of tumor nuclei staining positive. Sarah's oncologist informed her about a clinical trial investigating the combination of ribociclib, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, and bicalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, for patients with advanced AR+ TNBC. Sarah had an ECOG performance status of 1 and measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Her most recent ECG showed a QTc of 440ms and a resting heart rate of 72 bpm. She had no history of central nervous system metastases, and her last cancer treatment was completed six weeks ago. Sarah's laboratory tests demonstrated adequate bone marrow and organ function. She was not pregnant, had no other active malignancies, and had not received prior therapy with AR antagonists or CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Sarah had no significant cardiovascular history or other severe medical conditions that would contraindicate her participation in the study. She was not taking any medications known to prolong the QT interval or strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4/5."}
{"_id": "P_NCT03685331", "text": "Mia, a 54-year-old woman, was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her liver. Her tumor was estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and HER2-negative. Genetic testing revealed that Sarah carried a germline BRCA2 mutation. She had previously received one line of chemotherapy for her metastatic disease, which had been completed 4 months ago. Sarah's oncologist noted that her cancer was now progressing, and they were considering new treatment options. Her most recent scans showed measurable lesions in her liver, and her ECOG performance status was 1. Sarah had undergone natural menopause two years prior to her cancer diagnosis. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable, with no other malignancies or significant health issues. Laboratory tests showed adequate organ and bone marrow function. Sarah had not received any prior treatment with olaparib or palbociclib, and her last chemotherapy was more than three weeks ago. She had no brain metastases and was able to swallow oral medications without difficulty. Sarah was not pregnant or breastfeeding and was willing to use effective contraception throughout the study period if required."}
