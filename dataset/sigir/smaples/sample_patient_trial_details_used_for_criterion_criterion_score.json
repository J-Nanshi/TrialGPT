Active approaches are directed towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest wall or the cervical and thoracic spine (20%). The diagnostic approaches and treatment options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.~Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute, musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting self-management.~Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the patients are randomized into one of two groups: A) advice promoting self-management and individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B) a course of chiropractic therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment.",

In the recently published British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate of this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.~Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants (tetracycline, talc, and minocycline) have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence.",

Beta-blocker drugs are extensively used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure and after heart attacks to decrease symptoms and prolong life. Beta-agonists are used in COPD to decrease breathlessness and improve exercise tolerance. It used to be thought that beta-blockers cannot be used in COPD patients as they may make the breathlessness worse, but it has now been established that they can be used safely. Beta-blocker drugs and beta-agonists have 'opposite' effects on the body and the investigators do not know if they can work together or if they would cancel each other out. The investigators also do not know which of the different types of beta-blockers now available are better for COPD patients. This study will investigate what happens to the airways of people taking both of these drugs.",

                "brief_summary": "Hemodialysis (HD) patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) experience higher rates of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality than do the general population and many populations with other chronic diseases. This exceptional risk is explained in part by known risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and other uremia-related factors, including vascular calcification and stiffness, autonomic dysfunction, and a high burden of circulating inflammatory mediators. Recent studies suggest that blood pressure variability, especially intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH) is the most significant risk factor for these CV events. Studies have also shown that the use of IAB is capable of improving cardiovascular function for avoiding or minimizing the development of an orthostatic hypotensive episode (OHE) in patients with autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension (OH) in diabetes patients and children with orthostatic intolerance, and post-dialytic orthostatic hypotension (PDOH).~The investigators propose a study to examine the use of an abdominal compression elastic support (ACES) to prevent the development of IDH in patients who are known to be prone to these episodes. The ultimate goal is to facilitate more effective and safer dialysis therapy. The ACES has a configuration that is similar to a back-support work belt or an inflatable abdominal band (IAB). All of these devices are wrapped around to compress the abdomen at the waist.",

                "exclusion_criteria": " \n\n CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION: \n\n Ethnicity: Black \n\n This is a study of adult African Americans and Blacks that were born in Africa but are now living in the United States. As African American people are multi-ethnic, we will in this initial investigation, study two different groups of African American. To enroll participants must self-identify as African Americans and be born in the United States, with American born parents or be born in Africa with African born parents. In both groups we will study sex differences in the role of obesity and TG levels on cardiovascular disease. In the future, we plan to expand the study to include other groups which self-identify as African Americans (i.e.AfroCarribeans and Hispanic blacks). \n\n Only blacks are included in this study because the focus of this study is on gender differences in blacks in risk factors for CAD, specifically obesity, TG levels and TG related CAD risk factors. Unlike Caucasian women, premenopausal black women do not appear to be as protected from heart disease as a result of their gender. One model to study this apparent decrease in gender \n\n related cardioprotection in black women is to compare black men to black women. An alternative model would be to compare black women to Caucasian women. However, since the primary focus of this work is on gender differences rather than racial differences comparing black women to men is a superior model. Other racial groups do not share the loss of gender-related cardioprotection found in blacks, and have been excluded. Further the advantage of comparing black men and women is that this comparison provides a better control of dietary, cultural and genetic factors. \n\n Age: The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 70 years. As stated in the original protocol on page 14: Future investigations are planned which will involve similar comparisons between premenopausal and postmenopausal black women and between whites and blacks. To investigate risk for glucose intolerance, diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, it is no longer sufficient to maintain the age range between 18 and 50 years. We need to expand to an age range with an increased prevalence of these risk factors. \n\n Medical History: To participate in the study subjects should identify themselves as healthy. This is important so the broadest possible sample of people will enroll. The fact that people are healthy will be confirmed by the history, physical and laboratory tests done as part of the screening visit. People with established coronary artery as evidenced by history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or PTCA will be allowed to participate if they are not currently having angina. \n\n CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION: \n\n Black Ethnicity other than American or African. \n\n As stated in the inclusion criteria black people are a multi-ethnic group. In this initial investigation we are focusing on African Americans who are American born and Africans living in the United States who are African born. In the future, we will expand the study to include other groups of blacks such as individuals of Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic blacks. \n\n Medications: People who take medications that are known to alter the parameters which are under investigation in this study will be excluded. People taking medications to treat hyperlipidemia will be included but analyses will be adjusted to take this into account. Subjects on thyroid hormone replacement will be included if their TSH is normal. \n\n Diabetes: Because diabetes affects insulin sensitivity and TG levels all people with diabetes even if the diabetes is controlled with diet alone will not be enrolled in the study. \n\n Pregnant or Breastfeeding: Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have an infant that is less than four months of age will be excluded. This is because the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy, breastfeeding or recent childbirth affect the parameters under study. \n\n Menstrual History: Now that postmenopausal women are included, menstrual history will be taken but women with irregular menses and hysterectomy will not be excluded. Women between the ages of 40 and 55 years will have FSH checked for proper characterization. Women 56 years of age and older will be assumed to be postmenopausal. However, women on any type of injectable hormonal contraception will be excluded because hormonal contraception affects both TG levels and glucose metabolism.",
                "brief_summary": "It is unknown if obesity contributes to the development of heart disease in African American men and women.~This study was created to determine whether there is a relationship between sex and body size and the incidence of heart disease in African American men and women. Researchers will attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the blood (triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density lipoproteins [HDL]), how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in the body.~Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides (fat found in the blood) are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American women.~The study will take 2000 healthy non-diabetic African American men and women (ages 18-70) and body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight and obese. Diabetes undeniably increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients suffering from diabetes will not be included in the study. Candidates for the study will undergo a series of tests and examinations over 2 outpatient visits. Subjects will have body fat analyses, resting energy expenditure measurements, an EKG (electrocardiogram), and specific blood tests.~Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity and heart disease in African Americans.",

Most of the attention in treating ischemic heart disease (IHD) is understandably directed toward treating coronary artery disease. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients.~Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in IHD patients, even in the absence of hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel cor-onary disease or impaired LV function.~Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent with a history of successful use in type 2 diabetes. In the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), metformin was associated with a 39% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared with conventional therapy. Metformin also offered dual benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in nondiabetic patients.~Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether metformin could regress LVM in patients with IHD. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of metformin on LV volumes and endothelial function in this patient group.",

Moreover, while the rates of osteoporosis among Canadians are stabilizing, worldwide the number of people afflicted with osteoporosis continues to rise. The most serious complication of osteoporosis is a broken bone or fracture. Fractures due to osteoporosis can result in long hospital stays, dependence on others, and premature death. While there are several medications that prevent osteoporosis they all have side effects. For example, postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are at increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease. In addition, drugs to prevent osteoporosis are expensive and not available worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that researchers continue to identify and test new medications for the prevention of osteoporosis.~The purpose of the research is to determine if nitrates, a group of drugs that are widely available, inexpensive, and commonly used to treat chest pain or angina, can prevent osteoporosis in women. If the researchers find that nitrates prevent osteoporosis, a widely available, inexpensive treatment for osteoporosis prevention that does not have any long term side effects would have been identified. This will improve the health of patients with osteoporosis worldwide.",

                "brief_summary": "Few obesity prevention programs have produced weight gain prevention effects that persist over long-term follow-up and those that have are extremely lengthy, averaging 52 hr in duration, making implementation difficult and costly. The 2010 US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for treating child & adolescent obesity state that programs should have \u2265 25 hr of comprehensive treatment including dietary, physical activity and behavioral counseling, and that programs with < 25 hr usually do not produce improvements. The implication is that, if centers cannot provide this level of service (as most cannot), it is not worth providing any kind of treatment at all. In extreme exception to this, an intensive 3-hr non-restrictive obesity prevention program involving participant-driven healthy lifestyle improvement plans designed to bring caloric intake and output into balance (Healthy Weight) has been found to significantly reduce increases in BMI and obesity onset relative to alternative interventions and assessment-only controls through 3-yr follow-up. We propose to test an extended 6-hr version of the Healthy Weight intervention in a sample of primarily low SES, minority adolescents and young adults who are overweight and report body dissatisfaction and subthreshold eating disorder symptoms, as these are prevalent risk factors for obesity. We will test the hypothesis that participants assigned to the Healthy Weight vs. control intervention will have significantly lower BMI and % body fat during follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms. 300 adolescents and young adults at high risk for future weight gain by virtue of their age, BMI percentile, body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptomatology will be randomized to Healthy Weight or weight control educational video. Participants will complete assessments of BMI, body composition, potential mediators, and other outcomes at pretest, posttest and 6--mo follow-ups (in yr 1). Thus, to refute the USPSTF recommendations statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led by graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating disorders, suggesting this inexpensive and brief intervention could and should be rolled out nationwide.~Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce increases in BMI, % body fat, and risk for onset of obesity during follow-up.~Secondary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms.~NOTE: THIS STUDY IS ONLY OPEN TO PATIENTS AT THE MOUNT SINAI ADOLESCENT HEALTH CENTER",

Utilization of a monitor with a rapid response and easy clinical applicability which can demonstrate effective sympathetic block would increase efficiency within the procedure suite and also serve to function as an objective endpoint for the evaluation of sympathetic blockade in future research.In current clinical practice, the most commonly used monitoring methods are clinical observations of sympathetic blockade, skin temperature monitoring, pulse pressure monitoring and any combination of these monitoring methods. The skin temperature and pulse pressure may increase after sympathetic block. However, changes in the skin temperature and pulse pressure often demonstrate an unpredictable or delayed response. Confounding variables, such as ambient temperature, coexisting vascular disease, use of other vasoactive medications may contribute to inconsistencies in the temperature or pulse pressure responses.~Normal sympathetic activity stimulates muscarinic receptors in the periphery that subsequently stimulate the sweat glands to secrete and fill with sweat containing sodium and other electrolytes. The electrolytes present in the sweat increase the electrical conductance while decreasing the electrical resistance at the skin level.~The real-time changes in skin conductance indices can be monitored at the skin level, by use of non-invasive electrodes attached to the skin (similar to EKG electrodes). A computer program analyzes the data and produces a real-time graphic and numeric data demonstrating the skin conductance response. The initiation of successful sympathetic blockade can cause rapid cessation of the skin sympathetic activity that leads to a decrease in skin conductance within seconds.",

They are assessed by clinical history including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT calcium scoring (CTCS) is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, citation 1) proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain who have low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). They recommend that patients with low likelihood (10-30%) have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.~At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the traditional assessment. We also plan to follow-up these patients for any myocardial infarction and death from any cause.",

In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not effective solution in coronary artery diseases.~A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium (K) content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by hemoglobin (red-blood-cell) occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs, whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions.~This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content.

Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension. In addition to blood pressure lowering properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress, significantly. No adverse events were noted, suggesting that AC mycelia deserve its consideration as a candidate for safe alternative treatment to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.",

                "brief_summary": "Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which might be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.~BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACETM) Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still open.~The main study ('Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler for the treatment of obesity', multicenter study (MUMC+, AMC and St. Antonius), accepted by MEC AMC) seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of this plicating system for patients with severe obesity.~In this sub-study the investogators want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more information about the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler. Therefore the authors will measure changes in various parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism, before and after gastric plication (by using the BaroSense ACE\u2122 Stapler) in overweight subjects (these parameters will only be measured in patients at MUMC+). These parameters are post-prandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour towards food, food intake, satiety hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.~Objectives:~Aim of the present study will be to assess the effect of the BaroSense ACE\u2122 stapler on postprandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour towards food, food intake, hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.",

                "brief_summary": "Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) are a proven treatment for those with ischemic heart disease (IHD). These programs have been demonstrated to improve adherence to regular physical activity, a healthy diet and smoking cessation, as well as modify risk factors for IHD such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, CRP are cost effective and can result in a 25% reduction in reoccurrence of mortality. Despite the known benefits of CRP, as little as 10% to 25% of eligible patients attend these programs. One of the main barriers to attendance is proximity to a CRP, as the majority of these programs are limited to hospitals in large urban areas. However, cardiovascular diseases do not discriminate by geography, resulting in a geographic inequity of care for patients living in rural, remote and smaller urban/sub-urban centres. Currently there are no CRP specifically designed for patients in rural and remote areas. The use of the Internet may present itself as a viable alternative. We have recently completed a pilot study of a virtual CRP (vCRP) that demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and risk factors. This investigation will study the vCRP in a group of IHD patients who do not have access to hospital-based CRP.~Hypotheses A. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to usual care, in patients with diagnosed IHD.~B. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in significant improvements in exercise capacity after one year compared to usual care, in patients with diagnosed IHD.~Study Population Men and women over 18 years will be identified from consecutive in-patients of the British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver who reside in either the Northern Interior or Coast Garibaldi health areas. Patients will be eligible if they have IHD, Internet access, no previous experience with cardiac rehabilitation and no physical limitations to exercise. A total of 74 patients (37 per group) will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a 4 month 'virtual' cardiac rehabilitation program delivered via the Internet.~Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be provided with simple guidelines for safe exercising and healthy eating habits, and return to the care of their primary care physician. Patients will return at 4 and 16 months later for outcome assessment. There will be no contact between the study personnel and usual care patients for the duration of the study, nor will there be any attempt to control the level of patient care.~Intervention The vCRP has been developed to mimic hospital-based CRP and includes online intake forms, one-on-one chat sessions with vCRP nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist, data collection (exercise heart rate, blood pressure, glucose- if diabetic), peer-support group chat sessions, ask-an-expert chat sessions, education, progress reports and online resources. Upon randomization to the intervention, patients will receive access to the website, a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor and trained in their use. The heart rate monitors allow for exercise heart rate data to be stored and downloaded to their home computer and then uploaded to the vCRP webserver. The exercise data will be reviewed weekly. A letter to the patient's primary care physician will be sent to outline the vCRP intervention, the treatment algorithms to be used and indicate under what circumstances the vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact them with regards to their management. Patients will receive one-on-one counselling by the nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist via chat sessions at 3 to 4 week intervals. After the 4 month intervention, patients will be discharged into the care of their primary care physician.~Outcomes Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 16 months for risk factors and lifestyle behaviours. The primary outcomes will be the change in exercise capacity as between the two groups from baseline to 4 months, and from baseline to 16 months. Exercise capacity will be assessed as total time on a symptom-limited exercise stress test.",

                "brief_summary": "BACKGROUND: Although much has been written about the influence of local opinion leaders on clinical practice, there have been few controlled studies of their effect, and almost none have attempted to change prescribing in the community for chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or ischemic heart disease (IHD). These two conditions are common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality - and very good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have demonstrated that about half of eligible CHF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (and fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently needed.~HYPOTHESIS: An intervention that consists of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries, generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, will be able to change prescribing practices of community-based primary care physicians.~DESIGN: A single centre randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader intervention to usual care. Based on random allocation of all physicians in one large Canadian health region, patients with CHF or IHD (not receiving ACE inhibitors or statins, respectively) recruited from community pharmacies will be allocated to intervention or usual care. The primary outcome is improvement in prescription of proven efficacious therapies for CHF (ACE inhibitors) or IHD (statins) within 6 months of the intervention.",
