{"_id": "P_NCT02448420", "text": "Emma, a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. She had previously received three lines of systemic treatment for her metastatic disease, including trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Sarah's most recent scans showed progression of her liver metastases, and her oncologist was considering new treatment options. She had an ECOG performance status of 1 and adequate organ function, including a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Sarah's tumor tissue from a recent liver biopsy was available for biomarker analysis. She had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and had not received any investigational drugs in the last two weeks. Sarah had experienced some cardiotoxicity during her previous treatments but had recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension. She had no active infections or other severe uncontrolled medical conditions. Sarah was interested in exploring clinical trial options that could potentially offer new treatment combinations for her HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer."}
{"_id": "P_NCT02583828", "text": "Maria, a 72-year-old woman, was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that was estrogen receptor-positive. She had previously undergone standard chemotherapy, but her disease had progressed. Maria's oncologist found that she had measurable disease according to RECIST criteria, and her ECOG performance status was 1. Blood tests revealed adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Maria had no history of other malignancies and did not have any uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions. Her metastases were limited to the bones and lungs, with no brain involvement. Given her age and previous treatment history, Maria's medical team was considering alternative treatment options that might be more suitable for her current condition. They were particularly interested in exploring hormone therapy combined with low-dose chemotherapy as a potential approach to manage her metastatic breast cancer while maintaining her quality of life."}
{"_id": "P_NCT03500380", "text": "Victoria, a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. She had previously undergone treatment with trastuzumab for 8 months during her adjuvant therapy phase and received two lines of chemotherapy after her cancer relapsed and metastasized. Sarah's most recent treatment included a taxane-based regimen, which she completed 6 weeks ago. Unfortunately, her latest scans showed disease progression with liver metastases. Her oncologist noted that she had at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Sarah's overall health was good, with an ECOG performance status of 1. Her laboratory tests revealed adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. She had no history of cardiovascular issues, and her recent echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Sarah had not received any investigational drugs or major surgeries in the past few months. She had no known hypersensitivity to any medications and was not suffering from any uncontrolled systemic diseases. Sarah's medical history was negative for other malignancies, HIV, active hepatitis, or recent thromboembolic events. She had not received capecitabine treatment in the past and had no prior exposure to HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or T-DM1."}
{"_id": "P_NCT02716116", "text": "Hannah, a 52-year-old woman, was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) two years ago. Her tumor biopsy revealed an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation. Initially, Sarah received first-line chemotherapy for her metastatic disease, which resulted in a partial response. However, after 8 months, her disease progressed. She then underwent treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), but unfortunately did not show an objective response to this therapy. Sarah's most recent scans indicated further disease progression, with measurable lesions in her lungs and liver. She has an ECOG performance status of 1 and has maintained adequate organ function throughout her treatments. Sarah's medical history is otherwise unremarkable, with no other primary malignancies or significant cardiovascular issues. She has not received any radiotherapy in the past month and has not been taking any medications that are strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. Sarah's most recent brain MRI, performed two weeks ago, showed no evidence of CNS metastases. Despite the challenges of her disease, Sarah remains hopeful and is interested in exploring new treatment options that might offer her a chance at disease control and improved quality of life."}
{"_id": "P_NCT02615457", "text": "Nora, a 65-year-old woman, was recently diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. She underwent surgery to remove the tumor, which was confirmed by pathological examination and immunohistochemistry. Sarah had not received any preoperative anticancer drugs. Three days after her surgery, her liver and kidney function tests showed normal results, with AST and ALT levels below twice the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin within 1.5 times the upper limit, and serum creatinine below 1.5 times the upper limit. Her other laboratory tests were also within acceptable ranges, including hemoglobin at 110 g/L, platelet count of 180x10^9/L, and an absolute neutrophil count of 2.5x10^9/L. Sarah's overall health was good, with an expected survival time of more than 6 months. She had no history of severe acute or chronic diseases, diabetes, or serious infectious diseases. Sarah was not pregnant or lactating, and she had no issues with oral medication intake. She did not have any active bleeding, HIV infection, or AIDS-associated diseases. Sarah also had no history of drug abuse or psychological or mental health issues that could interfere with study compliance."}
