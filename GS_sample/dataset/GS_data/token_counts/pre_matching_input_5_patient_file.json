        "patient": "Emma, a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. She had previously received three lines of systemic treatment for her metastatic disease, including trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Sarah's most recent scans showed progression of her liver metastases, and her oncologist was considering new treatment options. She had an ECOG performance status of 1 and adequate organ function, including a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Sarah's tumor tissue from a recent liver biopsy was available for biomarker analysis. She had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and had not received any investigational drugs in the last two weeks. Sarah had experienced some cardiotoxicity during her previous treatments but had recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension. She had no active infections or other severe uncontrolled medical conditions. Sarah was interested in exploring clinical trial options that could potentially offer new treatment combinations for her HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

                "brief_summary": "Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of survival.~HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy. Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).~HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).~Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2 therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2 therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).~Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study, it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.~Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2 breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.~Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.",

Patients must have node-negative (N0) or micrometastases (N1mi) breast cancer according to the AJCC 8th edition anatomic staging table. \n\n If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then no further axillary dissection is required, and the patient is determined to be node-negative. Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters \u2264 0.2 mm by either H&E or immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be considered node-negative. \n\n Any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2cm is considered a micrometastasis. Patients with a micrometastasis are eligible. An axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a micrometastasis found by sentinel node evaluation. In cases where the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the overall principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility. The investigator must document approval in the patient medical record. \n\n Patients who have an area of T1aN0, ER+ (defined as \u2265 10%), HER2-negative cancer in either breast, in addition to their primary HER2 positive tumor, are eligible. \n\n For unifocal disease, all invasive disease must have been tested for ER and PR (for multifocal disease, see below).

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC subtype (that represents around 20% of all BC) was associated with poor prognosis however, new therapeutic advances have significantly increased the cure rate of patients in early stages.~In the metastatic setting, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have significantly improved overall survival (OS) with good quality of life, however there is still a substantial group of patients who die, and therefore additional drugs need to be investigated.~Trastuzumab, an anti HER2 antibody has demonstrated, in combination with chemotherapy, an improvement of OS in early and metastatic stages.~Tucatinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase subunit. Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).~Vinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.~This is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.",

Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment. \n\n Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event. \n\n Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment.

In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).",

In the second component of the trial (phase 3) researchers will assess if the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the optimal biological dose of efti in combination with paclitaxel is superior compared to chemotherapy alone (placebo-controlled).~The treatment concept of each trial component consists of a chemo-immunotherapy phase followed by an immunotherapy phase.

Pyrotinib is a new class I small molecule Tyrosine kinase inhibitors\uff08TKI\uff09 drug with high efficacy and low toxicity after the progress of trastuzumab therapy. Fulvestrant is the most preferred single-drug therapy for HR + metastatic breast cancer recommended unanimously by the guidelines, and fulvestrant and small molecule TKI have synergistic effects. Therefore, we envisage that fulvestrant combined with Pyrotinib in the treatment of HR+/HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in clinical practice has the advantages of improving efficacy and survival. To this end, we intend to conduct a prospective, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive\uff0chormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

                "brief_summary": "In early breast cancer (eBC), pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy acts as surrogate marker for metastasis and overall survival. Therapy intensification by adding an adjuvant therapy line (post-neoadjuvant treatment) substantially lowers the risk of relapse in high-risk breast cancer patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment (non-pCR). While this approach was exemplified in two phase III trials without biomarker-stratification (CREATE-X, KATHERINE), even higher efficiency might be achieved by individualized genomic-guided post-neoadjuvant therapies.~Within the seven-arm umbrella phase-II clinical trial COGNITION-GUIDE, we aim to deliver molecularly-tailored cancer care by implementing an additional response- and genomics-guided post-neoadjuvant therapy after finishing the guideline-compliant post-neoadjuvant treatment in high-risk breast cancer patients with residual cancer burden after neoadjuvant therapy to reduce the substantial risk of local and distant relapse.~The trial evaluates not a single drug but rather a general strategy of precision oncology in the curative setting and provides the basis for future confirmatory biomarker-driven trials.~Allocation to the therapy-arms is conducted by in depth molecular characterization of tumors within the COGNITION registry program.~The study aims to show an overall benefit of the precision medicine approach in high-risk eBC patients and to allow for secondary exploratory evaluation of each study-arm.~The primary endpoint of the study is invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) after 4 years measured from surgery to local or distant relapse or death. The sample size of the entire trial is 240 eligible patients.",

Note: No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority. \n\n The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to study treatment initiation. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed. \n\n Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. \n\n It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, participants who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.",

Her oncologist noted that she had at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Sarah's overall health was good, with an ECOG performance status of 1. Her laboratory tests revealed adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. She had no history of cardiovascular issues, and her recent echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Sarah had not received any investigational drugs or major surgeries in the past few months. She had no known hypersensitivity to any medications and was not suffering from any uncontrolled systemic diseases. Sarah's medical history was negative for other malignancies, HIV, active hepatitis, or recent thromboembolic events.

Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).~Vinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.~This is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.",

                "brief_summary": "The overall survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer has steadily improved over the past decades, mainly due to advances in systemic treatment. Despite these advances, the development of brain metastases remains a serious and devastating complication that decreases quality of life and increases morbidity and mortality. The HER2CLIMB randomized study demonstrated that adding the investigational drug tucatinib to the standard treatment trastuzumab and capecitabine improved both progression-free survival and overall survival in people diagnosed with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. In patients with brain metastases, the 1-year progression-free survival was 25% in the tucatinib group and 0% in the placebo group.~These results suggest that tucatinib may be a new standard treatment for HER2-positive metastatic disease.~The aim of the non-randomized phase II study, InTTercePT, is to evaluate the effectiveness of adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the event of cerebral progression, after the end of local treatment.",

                "brief_summary": "Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of survival.~HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy. Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).~HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).~Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2 therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2 therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).~Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study, it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.~Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2 breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.~Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.",

She then underwent treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), but unfortunately did not show an objective response to this therapy. Sarah's most recent scans indicated further disease progression, with measurable lesions in her lungs and liver. She has an ECOG performance status of 1 and has maintained adequate organ function throughout her treatments. Sarah's medical history is otherwise unremarkable, with no other primary malignancies or significant cardiovascular issues. She has not received any radiotherapy in the past month and has not been taking any medications that are strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. Sarah's most recent brain MRI, performed two weeks ago, showed no evidence of CNS metastases. Despite the challenges of her disease, Sarah remains hopeful and is interested in exploring new treatment options that might offer her a chance at disease control and improved quality of life.",

Participants were assigned randomly to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 Q3W. The total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis.~Eligible participants who were allocated to the first course of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to receive a second course of pembrolizumab as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.~Protocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.~With Protocol Amendment 15 (effective date: 03 Jan 2018), all second course and switch over participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Response or progression during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards efficacy outcome measures, and adverse events during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards safety outcome measures.~Also with Amendment 15, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study (Keynote 587; NCT03486873) to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Switch over participants who have not transitioned to pembrolizumab will be considered for the extension study on a case-by-case basis.~The primary study hypotheses are that pembolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent radiologists' review in previously-treated participants with NSCLC in the strongly positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) stratum compared to docetaxel and in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 compared to docetaxel.",

The study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the safety, efficacy and PK of NUC-3373 in combination with other agents for the treatment of patients with different tumour types.~Each module is designed to evaluate a different NUC-3373 combination and consists of a dose-validation phase (Phase Ib) and a dose-expansion phase (Phase II).~Phase Ib of each module will determine the safety and tolerability of the combinations for further clinical evaluation in Phase II. Approximately 6-20 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Phase Ib stage of each module to determine safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of NUC-3373 in combination with other agents. Each module will then move into Phase II to enable a further assessment of safety and efficacy in approximately 20-40 patients.~Module 1 will assess NUC-3373 + leucovorin (LV) in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumours who have progressed on \u22642 prior therapies for metastatic disease, that may have included 1 prior immunotherapy-containing regimen (either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy) or who have not progressed but where addition of NUC-3373 + LV to standard pembrolizumab monotherapy may be appropriate (e.g., patients who could not tolerate post-IO standard of care therapy).~Module 2 will assess NUC-3373 + LV in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pleural mesothelioma who have progressed on, or were unable to tolerate, 1 or 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy-containing regimens for advanced/metastatic disease.~The opening of each module will be at the discretion of the Sponsor.

                "brief_summary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects of cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating patients with cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) and who are undergoing treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and nivolumab may shrink or stabilize cancer in patients undergoing treatment for HIV.",

Methods and drugs to further improve the therapeutic effect of TNBC patients are still being explored.~Camrelizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor produced by Hengrui, has been approved for the treatment of various malignant tumors including advanced lung cancer, advanced liver cancer and advanced esophageal cancer. Shows good therapeutic effect and safety.~Therefore, this study intends to explore the superiority of camrelizumab on the basis of the less toxic anthracycline-free TCb regimen.In order to provide more effective and safe neoadjuvant therapy for lymph node-positive TNBC patients.",

Its incidence is approximately 180,000 cases per year. TNBC are known to be more aggressive with poor prognosis specially when no pathologic complete response (pCR) is achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a higher risk of recurrence and a poor survival once that recurrence occurs. On the other hand, there is not a specific adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for these patients. Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) allows the usage of higher doses of chemotherapy, which results in higher cellular destruction with a decrease of hematological toxicity, it is proposed that this procedure is able to improve prognosis in TNBC patients with no pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

Prognoses remain poor, with reported median overall survival estimates of approximately 18 months or less with available treatments. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials showed that the median objective response rate (ORR) of second or later line of chemotherapy in mTNBC was only 11%.~Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model, which preserves the histologic and genetic characteristics of patients' tumors, has shown its predictive value of clinical outcomes and are used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biological studies, and personalized medicine strategies. However, long time period and low success rate has limited its application in clinical practice.~Mini patient derived xenograft (miniPDX) offers an effective alternative as it only takes about 7 days for drug sensitivity test and could thus provide guidance for prompt personalized treatment for each patient.~Thus, the investigators conduct this single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study to investigate the efficacy of guided treatment based on Mini-PDX in patients with metastatic refractory triple negative breast cancer.",

Clinical characteristics include early onset, high malignancy and heterogeneity. There is no effective drug target for TNBC, resulting in poor outcomes, high relapse rate and distant metastasis. So, further research on TNBC pathological features is particularly important.~Compared with the solvent-based paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-P) demonstrates a stronger therapeutic effect. With albumin nanoparticles as a carrier, nab-P increases the concentration of extra-tumor drugs by passing through the albumin receptor (Gp60) transmembrane pathway and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) approach that binds to the extracellular matrix of the tumor. Numerous clinical trials have found that nab-P is superior to the solvent-based paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer, especially in breast cancer with poor prognosis. However, the current efficacy of nab-P in the treatment of TNBC has not been fully verified. The mechanism underlying the killing effect of nab-P on TNBC breast cancer cells remains unclear yet. This trial will compare the therapeutic effect of nab-P with solvent-based paclitaxel in TNBC patients, and seek for important scientific clues, scientific evidence, and clinical data for nab-P in the treatment of TNBC.",

                "brief_summary": "According to the latest data from the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for 2020, breast cancer has been the most prevalent cancer with 2.26 million new cases. Among Chinese breast cancer patients, approximately 60% are hormone receptor (HR) positive, and 80% have early-stage breast cancer. For HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer patients, the first peak of recurrence is about 2-3 years after surgery, especially for patients with high-risk clinical and/or pathological features. Therefore, adjuvant therapy is essential to reduce recurrence during this period.~Capecitabine is an anti-metabolite fluoropyrimidine deoxynucleoside carbamate that can be converted to fluorouracil (5-Fu) in vivo. Studies have shown that patients with HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer with high-risk factors may benefit from postoperative adjuvant capecitabine therapy as well as patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Therefore, we assumed that additional capecitabine may reduce the reccurence of breast cancer in patients with high-risk factors.~This trial is an open, single-arm clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of additional adjuvant capecitabine therapy on recurrence and survival in HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients with high-risk factors.",
