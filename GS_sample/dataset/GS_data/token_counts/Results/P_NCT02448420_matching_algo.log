 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.

Title: Study of Palbociclib and Trastuzumab With Endocrine Therapy in HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Interventions: Palbociclib, Trastuzumab, Endocrine therapy, Chemotherapy, Antibody-Drug Conjugates
Summary: PATRICIA is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease. Cohorts A, B1, and B2 based on their HR status and treatment allocation were planned.~Cohort A included patients with hormone receptor-negative, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib.~Cohort B1 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib.~Cohort B2 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib + letrozole.~The aim of the PATRICIA study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib to standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival.~Based on interim results from this trial that support the benefit of CDK4 / 6 inhibition in luminal disease, two additional cohorts will be included.

Title: A Study to Evaluate Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel vs. Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel in Previously Untreated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Interventions: Pertuzumab, Placebo, Trastuzumab, Docetaxel
Summary: This study was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international clinical trial conducted to investigate the use of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as first-line treatment for participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Participants could have received one prior hormonal treatment for MBC. Participants may have received systemic breast cancer treatment in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting, provided that the participant had experienced a disease-free interval (DFI) of greater than or equal to (≥)12 months from completion of adjuvant systemic treatment (excluding hormonal therapy) to metastatic diagnosis. Participants may have received trastuzumab and/or a taxane during the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.~Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either pertuzumab or placebo, along with trastuzumab and docetaxel once every 3 weeks (q3w), during the treatment phase of the study until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Participants in the Placebo arm were not allowed to receive open-label pertuzumab after discontinuation from study treatment. However, if any analysis of overall survival had met the predefined criteria for statistical significance, participants in the Placebo arm still on treatment were offered the option to receive open-label pertuzumab in addition to other study medications.
Exclusion criteria:

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.

Title: Phase IB & II Study of Ribociclib With Trastuzumab Plus Letrozole in Postmenopausal HR+, HER2+ Advanced Breast Cancer Patients
Target diseases: HER2-positive Breast Cancer, Postmenopausal, Metastatic Breast Cancer
Interventions: Ribociclib, Trastuzumab, Letrozole
Summary: Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of survival.~HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy. Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).~HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).~Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2 therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2 therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).~Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study, it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.~Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2 breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.~Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. - Patients who have previously received CDK4 / 6 inhibitors or who have received other systemic treatments for advanced / metastatic breast cancer (Previous neo-adjuvant of adjuvant trastuzumab or aromatase inhibitor is not allowed, unless

7. Patients who is currently receiving medications that can prolong QT intervals (QTc>450msec) on ECG or that can cause torsades de pointes
8. Patients with severe visceral metastasis on enrolment who are not indicated with hormone treatment
9. Serious surgical treatment within 14 days prior to study treatment
10. Radiotherapy within 21 days prior to study treatment

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,

Title: A Study of Tucatinib or Placebo With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab for Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer
Target diseases: HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
Interventions: Tucatinib, Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, Combination product: Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab, Placebo
Summary: This study is being done to see if tucatinib works better than placebo when given with other drugs to treat participants with HER2-positive breast cancer. A placebo is a pill that looks the same as tucatinib but has no medicine in it. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating your disease.~Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).~In this study, all participants will get either tucatinib or placebo. Participants will be assigned randomly to a group. This is a blinded study, so patients and their doctors will not know which group a participant is in.~All participants will also get trastuzumab and pertuzumab. These are 2 drugs used to treat this type of cancer.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Prior treatment with any tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) including pyrotinib, lapatinib, tucatinib, neratinib, and afatinib (except neratinib if given in extended adjuvant setting and ≥ 12 months have elapsed since last neratinib dose prior to start of study drug)
1. Unable to undergo contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain
2. CNS Exclusion - Based on screening brain MRI and clinical assessment
3. Symptomatic brain metastasis after CNS-directed local therapy
4. Progression of brain metastases since starting first line trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane
5. Ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids at a total daily dose of >2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent)
6. Any untreated brain lesion in an anatomic site which may pose risk to participant
7. Known or suspected leptomeningeal disease (LMD)
8. Poorly controlled (>1/week) seizures, or other persistent neurologic symptoms

Title: Anlotinib Combined With Chemotherapy and Neoadjuvant Therapy for Hormone Receptor-positive HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Breast Cancer Stage II
Interventions: Anlotinib
Summary: Anlotinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that strongly inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit. Combining anti-angiogenesis with chemotherapy yielded increased response rates in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding anlotinib to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated stage ⅡB-IIIA histologically documented (HER2)-negative breast cancer were assigned to receive chemotherapy plus oral Anlotinib. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) (no invasive carcinoma in breast or axilla). Secondary end points included safety and disease-free survival (DFS).
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Previously received anti-angiogenesis targeted drug therapy.
1. patients have previous diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, cardiac failure, gastroduodenal ulcer, symptomatic diverticulitis, or inflammatory bowel disease.
2. Previously received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or endocrine therapy as treatment for breast cancer was allowed.
3. No uncont rolled hypertension.

For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.

Title: Pyrotinib in Combination With Fulvestrant in Patients With HER2 Positive，HR-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Interventions: Pyrotinib combined with fulvestrant
Summary: HR+/HER2+（Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive and hormone receptor positive）metastatic breast cancer is a special subtype of HER2+breast cancer. Conventional guidelines recommend chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab targeted therapy for this subtype of patients. However, the choice of treatment for these patients after treatment progress is a research hotspot in this field. Pyrotinib is a new class I small molecule Tyrosine kinase inhibitors（TKI） drug with high efficacy and low toxicity after the progress of trastuzumab therapy. Fulvestrant is the most preferred single-drug therapy for HR + metastatic breast cancer recommended unanimously by the guidelines, and fulvestrant and small molecule TKI have synergistic effects. Therefore, we envisage that fulvestrant combined with Pyrotinib in the treatment of HR+/HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in clinical practice has the advantages of improving efficacy and survival. To this end, we intend to conduct a prospective, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive，hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Patients who have not received trastuzumab, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy before;
1. Patients with visceral crisis;
2. Patients unable to swallow, with chronic diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, or multiple factors that affect drug use and absorption;
3. Patients with malignant serous effusion which cannot be controlled by drainage or other methods;
4. Less than 4 weeks from the last treatment in the last clinical trial;
5. Receiving any other antitumor therapy;
6. History of other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been previously treated with curative intent;
7. Patients with serious heart disease;
8. Allergy to Pyrotinib; the history of immunodeficiency；
9. Known history of neurological or psychiatric disease, including epilepsy or dementia;
10. Patients during pregnancy or lactation, patients with childbearing potential tested positive in a baseline pregnancy test, or patients unwilling to take effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial;
11. Evidence of significant medical illness that will substantially increase the risk of the participation or completion of the study in the investigator's judgment. Examples included, but not limited to, hypertension, severe diabetes, etc;
12. Patients not eligible for this study judged by the investigator.

Title: Study in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Eftilagimod Alpha or Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel Chemotherapy
Target diseases: Breast Carcinoma
Interventions: eftilagimod alpha, Paclitaxel, placebo
Summary: The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of eftilagimod alpha (efti) in combination with paclitaxel standard of care chemotherapy in participants with metastatic breast cancer.~The main questions it aims to answer are:~What is the optimal biological dose (OBD) of efti in combination with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy?~Can efti combined with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy prolong overall survival in participants with metastatic breast cancer if compared to weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy alone.~In the first component of the trial (phase 2, lead-in) researchers will compare two groups (different dose levels of efti in combination with standard chemotherapy) to see if the treatment is safe and well tolerated and evaluate which is the optimal biological dose. In the second component of the trial (phase 3) researchers will assess if the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the optimal biological dose of efti in combination with paclitaxel is superior compared to chemotherapy alone (placebo-controlled).~The treatment concept of each trial component consists of a chemo-immunotherapy phase followed by an immunotherapy phase. In the first phase participants will be treated with efti plus paclitaxel chemotherapy or placebo plus paclitaxel chemotherapy. After completion of the chemotherapy per standard of care, participants will be treated with the study agent alone.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast adenocarcinoma
1. Participants with HR+ MBC who have received <1 line of ET based therapy in the metastatic setting
2. Participants with HR+ MBC who are not primary or secondary resistant to ET-based therapy and would be candidates to ET based therapy as per applicable treatment guidelines
3. TNBC participants who are candidates for PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy
4. Disease-free interval of less than twelve months from the last dose of adjuvant chemotherapy

Title: A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Treatment Combinations in Participants With Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Inoperable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic, ER-positive Breast Cancer
Interventions: Giredestrant, Abemaciclib, Ipatasertib, Inavolisib, Ribociclib, Everolimus, Samuraciclib, PH FDC SC, Palbociclib, Atezolizumab
Summary: This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants with breast cancer. Cohort 1 will focus on participants with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had disease progression during or following treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i; e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) in the first- or second-line setting. Cohort 2 will focus on inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, ER-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer with previous progression to standard-of-care anti-HER2 therapies, of which one was a trastuzumab-and-taxane-based systemic therapy (including in the early setting if recurrence occurred within 6 months of finishing adjuvant therapy) and one was a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab-deruxtecan) or a HER2-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; e.g., tucatinib, lapatinib, pyrotinib or neratinib). The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the patient population. During Stage 1, participants in each cohort will be randomly assigned to treatment arms. Participants in the control or experimental arms who experience unacceptable toxicity, disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator during Stage 1 will be given the option of receiving a different treatment combination during Stage 2, provided they meet eligibility criteria and a treatment arm is open for enrollment. No Stage 2 treatment is currently available.

Title: BI-1607 in Combination With Trastuzumab in Subjects With HER2-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
Target diseases: HER2-positive Breast Cancer, HER2-positive Gastric Cancer, HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, Metastatic Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, Metastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Interventions: BI-1607, BI-1607, Trastuzumab
Summary: HER2+ breast and gastric cancer patients' survival is significantly improved by trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, many patients remain uncured and develop resistance to trastuzumab resulting in relapse or progression of the disease. BI-1607, a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) targets CD32b (Fc Gamma Receptor IIB), it is intended to enhance the efficacy and overcome resistance to existing cancer treatments such as trastuzumab.~This is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, consecutive-cohort study of BI-1607 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with HER2+ advanced solid tumors whose tumor has progressed after standard therapy.
Exclusion criteria:

3. Has had clinically significant lung disease requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment within the last 6 months of enrollment.
4. Has an active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease.
5. Is at high medical risk because of nonmalignant systemic disease including severe active infections on treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals.
6. Has presence of chronic graft versus host disease.
7. Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.

Title: Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Trastuzumab Plus TUCAtinib Plus viNorelbine in Patients With HER2-positive Non-resectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target diseases: HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, Locally Advanced HER2 Positive Breast Carcinoma
Interventions: Tucatinib, Trastuzumab, Vinorelbine
Summary: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in the world. In Spain, one in 8 women is diagnosed with BC. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC subtype (that represents around 20% of all BC) was associated with poor prognosis however, new therapeutic advances have significantly increased the cure rate of patients in early stages.~In the metastatic setting, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have significantly improved overall survival (OS) with good quality of life, however there is still a substantial group of patients who die, and therefore additional drugs need to be investigated.~Trastuzumab, an anti HER2 antibody has demonstrated, in combination with chemotherapy, an improvement of OS in early and metastatic stages.~Tucatinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase subunit. Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).~Vinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.~This is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:
1. Have received more than 4 lines of systemic therapy for locally advanced or MBC.
2. Have received prior treatment with tucatinib, vinorelbine for locally advanced or MBC or anti-HER2 TKI agents if administered less than 12 months prior to study entry.
3. Have used a strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitor or CYP3A substrate within 2 weeks, or a strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducer within 5 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (see Protocol Attachment 2 for more information).

11. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks (3 weeks if WBRT) prior to starting study treatment (all acute toxic effects must be resolved to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 grade <1, except toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator´s discretion). Patients who received prior radiotherapy to >25% of bone marrow are not eligible regardless of when it was administered.
12. Major surgery or other anti-cancer therapy not previously specified within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment, Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy or surgical procedures to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator´s discretion) is mandatory.

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,

Title: SEQUence of Endocrine Therapy in Advanced Luminal Breast Cancer (SEQUEL-Breast)
Target diseases: Neoplasm, Breast, Congenital, Familial and Genetic Disorders
Interventions: Alpelisib 150 MG Oral Tablet [Piqray], Fulvestrant
Summary: The study is a nationwide, multicenter single-arm phase 2 study. The current phase 2 study investigates the efficacy of the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib directly after progression on fulvestrant (either in first or second line, with or without previous use of CDK4/6-inhibitor) in patients with HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer with PIK3CA mutated tumors.~All eligible patients must have progressive disease on fulvestrant as latest treatment line.~Previous treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in first or second line is obligatory. After progressive disease is confirmed, it is important to continue fulvestrant (without CDK4/6 inhibition) during the screening period awaiting study enrollment.~After study enrollment all participants will be treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant beyond progression. Follow-up time will be until progression or death or until a different oncolytic treatment has started (in case no progressive disease during previous fulvestrant and alpelisib treatment has been documented).~Should participants discontinue due to reasons other than progression or death (e.g. toxicity), then they should still be evaluated for disease progression every 8 weeks as per protocol until progression, unless they do not wish to proceed with these screenings, or receive a different oncolytic treatment.
Exclusion criteria:
 0. Patients with advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread, who are at risk of life-threatening complications in theshort term
1. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningealdisease as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth
2. Prior treatment with a PI3K /AKT/mTOR inhibitor
3. Type 1 diabetes or uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (Hba1C > 68 mmol/mol)
4. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac events

Title: Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer
Target diseases: Breast Cancer
Interventions: Tamoxifen, Anastrozole, Fulvestrant
Summary: RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a one-size-fits- all approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).
Exclusion criteria:
 0. ) and clinical laboratory parameters as deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician.
1. Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)
2. Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.
The factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.
You should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:
	Element 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.
	Element 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.
	Element 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {"not applicable", "not enough information", "excluded", "not excluded"}. "not applicable" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. "not enough information" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less "not enough information" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. "excluded" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while "not excluded" means the reverse.
You should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.,
