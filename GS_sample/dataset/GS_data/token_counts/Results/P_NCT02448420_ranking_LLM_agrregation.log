Title: Study of Palbociclib and Trastuzumab With Endocrine Therapy in HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Summary: PATRICIA is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease. Cohorts A, B1, and B2 based on their HR status and treatment allocation were planned.~Cohort A included patients with hormone receptor-negative, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib.~Cohort B1 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib.~Cohort B2 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who received trastuzumab + palbociclib + letrozole.~The aim of the PATRICIA study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib to standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival.~Based on interim results from this trial that support the benefit of CDK4 / 6 inhibition in luminal disease, two additional cohorts will be included.

Title: A Study to Evaluate Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel vs. Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel in Previously Untreated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Summary: This study was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international clinical trial conducted to investigate the use of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as first-line treatment for participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Participants could have received one prior hormonal treatment for MBC. Participants may have received systemic breast cancer treatment in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting, provided that the participant had experienced a disease-free interval (DFI) of greater than or equal to (≥)12 months from completion of adjuvant systemic treatment (excluding hormonal therapy) to metastatic diagnosis. Participants may have received trastuzumab and/or a taxane during the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.~Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either pertuzumab or placebo, along with trastuzumab and docetaxel once every 3 weeks (q3w), during the treatment phase of the study until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Participants in the Placebo arm were not allowed to receive open-label pertuzumab after discontinuation from study treatment. However, if any analysis of overall survival had met the predefined criteria for statistical significance, participants in the Placebo arm still on treatment were offered the option to receive open-label pertuzumab in addition to other study medications.

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

Title: Phase IB & II Study of Ribociclib With Trastuzumab Plus Letrozole in Postmenopausal HR+, HER2+ Advanced Breast Cancer Patients
Target conditions: HER2-positive Breast Cancer, Postmenopausal, Metastatic Breast Cancer
Summary: Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of survival.~HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy. Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).~HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).~Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2 therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2 therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).~Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study, it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.~Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2 breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.~Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.

Here is the clinical trial description:
Title: A Study of Tucatinib or Placebo With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab for Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer
Target conditions: HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
Summary: This study is being done to see if tucatinib works better than placebo when given with other drugs to treat participants with HER2-positive breast cancer. A placebo is a pill that looks the same as tucatinib but has no medicine in it. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating your disease.~Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).~In this study, all participants will get either tucatinib or placebo. Participants will be assigned randomly to a group. This is a blinded study, so patients and their doctors will not know which group a participant is in.~All participants will also get trastuzumab and pertuzumab. These are 2 drugs used to treat this type of cancer.

Title: Anlotinib Combined With Chemotherapy and Neoadjuvant Therapy for Hormone Receptor-positive HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Breast Cancer Stage II
Summary: Anlotinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that strongly inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit. Combining anti-angiogenesis with chemotherapy yielded increased response rates in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding anlotinib to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated stage ⅡB-IIIA histologically documented (HER2)-negative breast cancer were assigned to receive chemotherapy plus oral Anlotinib.

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

Title: Pyrotinib in Combination With Fulvestrant in Patients With HER2 Positive，HR-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Metastatic Breast Cancer
Summary: HR+/HER2+（Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive and hormone receptor positive）metastatic breast cancer is a special subtype of HER2+breast cancer. Conventional guidelines recommend chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab targeted therapy for this subtype of patients. However, the choice of treatment for these patients after treatment progress is a research hotspot in this field. Pyrotinib is a new class I small molecule Tyrosine kinase inhibitors（TKI） drug with high efficacy and low toxicity after the progress of trastuzumab therapy. Fulvestrant is the most preferred single-drug therapy for HR + metastatic breast cancer recommended unanimously by the guidelines, and fulvestrant and small molecule TKI have synergistic effects. Therefore, we envisage that fulvestrant combined with Pyrotinib in the treatment of HR+/HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in clinical practice has the advantages of improving efficacy and survival. To this end, we intend to conduct a prospective, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive，hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Here is the clinical trial description:
Title: Study in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Eftilagimod Alpha or Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel Chemotherapy
Target conditions: Breast Carcinoma
Summary: The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of eftilagimod alpha (efti) in combination with paclitaxel standard of care chemotherapy in participants with metastatic breast cancer.~The main questions it aims to answer are:~What is the optimal biological dose (OBD) of efti in combination with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy?~Can efti combined with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy prolong overall survival in participants with metastatic breast cancer if compared to weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy alone.~In the first component of the trial (phase 2, lead-in) researchers will compare two groups (different dose levels of efti in combination with standard chemotherapy) to see if the treatment is safe and well tolerated and evaluate which is the optimal biological dose. In the second component of the trial (phase 3) researchers will assess if the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the optimal biological dose of efti in combination with paclitaxel is superior compared to chemotherapy alone (placebo-controlled).~The treatment concept of each trial component consists of a chemo-immunotherapy phase followed by an immunotherapy phase. In the first phase participants will be treated with efti plus paclitaxel chemotherapy or placebo plus paclitaxel chemotherapy. After completion of the chemotherapy per standard of care, participants will be treated with the study agent alone.

Title: A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Treatment Combinations in Participants With Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Inoperable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic, ER-positive Breast Cancer
Summary: This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants with breast cancer. Cohort 1 will focus on participants with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had disease progression during or following treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i; e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) in the first- or second-line setting. Cohort 2 will focus on inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, ER-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer with previous progression to standard-of-care anti-HER2 therapies, of which one was a trastuzumab-and-taxane-based systemic therapy (including in the early setting if recurrence occurred within 6 months of finishing adjuvant therapy) and one was a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab-deruxtecan) or a HER2-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; e.g., tucatinib, lapatinib, pyrotinib or neratinib). The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the patient population. During Stage 1, participants in each cohort will be randomly assigned to treatment arms. Participants in the control or experimental arms who experience unacceptable toxicity, disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator during Stage 1 will be given the option of receiving a different treatment combination during Stage 2, provided they meet eligibility criteria and a treatment arm is open for enrollment. No Stage 2 treatment is currently available.

Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).

4. Sarah's tumor tissue from a recent liver biopsy was available for biomarker analysis.
5. She had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and had not received any investigational drugs in the last two weeks.
6. Sarah had experienced some cardiotoxicity during her previous treatments but had recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension.
7. She had no active infections or other severe uncontrolled medical conditions.
8. Sarah was interested in exploring clinical trial options that could potentially offer new treatment combinations for her HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Here is the clinical trial description:
Title: Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Trastuzumab Plus TUCAtinib Plus viNorelbine in Patients With HER2-positive Non-resectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target conditions: HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, Locally Advanced HER2 Positive Breast Carcinoma
Summary: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in the world. In Spain, one in 8 women is diagnosed with BC. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC subtype (that represents around 20% of all BC) was associated with poor prognosis however, new therapeutic advances have significantly increased the cure rate of patients in early stages.~In the metastatic setting, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have significantly improved overall survival (OS) with good quality of life, however there is still a substantial group of patients who die, and therefore additional drugs need to be investigated.~Trastuzumab, an anti HER2 antibody has demonstrated, in combination with chemotherapy, an improvement of OS in early and metastatic stages.~Tucatinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase subunit. Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).~Vinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.~This is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.

Here is the clinical trial description:
Title: SEQUence of Endocrine Therapy in Advanced Luminal Breast Cancer (SEQUEL-Breast)
Target conditions: Neoplasm, Breast, Congenital, Familial and Genetic Disorders
Summary: The study is a nationwide, multicenter single-arm phase 2 study. The current phase 2 study investigates the efficacy of the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib directly after progression on fulvestrant (either in first or second line, with or without previous use of CDK4/6-inhibitor) in patients with HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer with PIK3CA mutated tumors.~All eligible patients must have progressive disease on fulvestrant as latest treatment line.~Previous treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in first or second line is obligatory. After progressive disease is confirmed, it is important to continue fulvestrant (without CDK4/6 inhibition) during the screening period awaiting study enrollment.~After study enrollment all participants will be treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant beyond progression. Follow-up time will be until progression or death or until a different oncolytic treatment has started (in case no progressive disease during previous fulvestrant and alpelisib treatment has been documented).~Should participants discontinue due to reasons other than progression or death (e.g. toxicity), then they should still be evaluated for disease progression every 8 weeks as per protocol until progression, unless they do not wish to proceed with these screenings, or receive a different oncolytic treatment.

Here is the clinical trial description:
Title: Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer
Target conditions: Breast Cancer
Summary: RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a one-size-fits- all approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

Here are the criterion-levle eligibility prediction:
inclusion criterion 0: Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.
	Patient relevance: The patient has HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, not invasive lobular breast cancer as required by the criterion.
	Evident sentences: [0]
	Patient eligibility: not included
inclusion criterion 1: Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event.
	Patient relevance: The patient note does not specify the type of biopsies performed or planned, only that tumor tissue from a liver biopsy was available.
	Evident sentences: [4]
	Patient eligibility: not enough information
inclusion criterion 2: Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. HER2 status will be determined locally only, based upon current ASCO/CAP guidelines.
	Patient relevance: The patient's tumor is documented as hormone receptor-positive, but it is HER2-positive, not HER2-negative as required.
	Evident sentences: [0]
	Patient eligibility: not included
inclusion criterion 3: Patients must be female.
	Patient relevance: The patient is female as indicated by the use of 'she' in the note.

	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 1: Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)
	Patient relevance: The patient note does not mention any use of hormone contraceptives or replacement therapy. Given the patient's medical context and the specificity of such treatments, it is reasonable to assume they were not used recently if not mentioned.
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 2: Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.
	Patient relevance: The patient note explicitly states that the patient will provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol. This indicates that the patient is aware of her condition and the study requirements.

Title: Margetuximab Plus Chemotherapy vs Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in the Treatment of HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
Target conditions: HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer, Metastatic Neoplasm
Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with margetuximab plus chemotherapy have longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.~A non-randomized sub-study cohort of approximately 88 patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of a reduced margetuximab infusion rate in patients receiving margetuximab either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.

Here are the criterion-levle eligibility prediction:
inclusion criterion 0: Histologically-proven metastatic or locally-advanced relapsed/refractory HER2+ breast cancer based on the most recently available tumor biopsy collected from the patient. Tumors may be estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) positive or negative.
	Patient relevance: The patient's note states she was diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, which matches the criterion of having histologically-proven metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. The tumor is also ER/PgR positive as indicated.
	Evident sentences: [0]
	Patient eligibility: included
inclusion criterion 1: Have received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting, or in case of having received (neo)adjuvant pertuzumab, at least 1 prior line of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting. In either case, patients must have received prior treatment with pertuzumab, in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting. Prior radiotherapy, hormonal therapies, and other anti-HER2 therapies are allowed.
	Patient relevance: The patient has received three lines of systemic treatment for her metastatic disease, including trastuzumab, which meets the criterion of having received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy. However, there is no mention of pertuzumab specifically.
	Evident sentences: [1]
	Patient eligibility: not enough information
inclusion criterion 2: Prior treatment with at least one, and no more than three, lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting. Patients must have progressed on or following, the most recent line of therapy.
	Patient relevance: The patient has received three lines of therapy in the metastatic setting and has shown progression following the most recent line of therapy, fulfilling this criterion.
	Evident sentences: [1, 2]
	Patient eligibility: included
inclusion criterion 3: Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities to ≤ Grade 1
	Patient relevance: The patient note mentions that she had some cardiotoxicity but recovered, with no current signs of severe toxicity. This suggests that any previous toxicities have resolved to ≤ Grade 1.
	Evident sentences: [6]
	Patient eligibility: included
inclusion criterion 4: Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks
	Patient relevance: There is no direct mention of life expectancy, but given the patient's active consideration of new treatments and no severe uncontrolled conditions, it can be inferred that her life expectancy is at least 12 weeks.
	Evident sentences: [7, 8]
	Patient eligibility: included
inclusion criterion 5: Acceptable laboratory parameters
	Patient relevance: The patient note mentions adequate organ function and no severe uncontrolled medical conditions, which suggests acceptable laboratory parameters.
	Evident sentences: [3, 7]
	Patient eligibility: included
inclusion criterion 6: Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test performed within 14 days of randomization and on the first day of treatment. All subjects must agree to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug.
	Patient relevance: The patient is described as postmenopausal, which implies she is not of childbearing potential, thus this criterion is not applicable.
	Evident sentences: [0]
	Patient eligibility: not applicable
inclusion criterion 7: Infusion sub-study prior therapy requirements: Same as above, except:
	Patient relevance: This criterion is specific to a sub-study and does not apply to the general study criteria.
	Patient eligibility: not applicable
inclusion criterion 8: Must have received 4 or more prior lines or therapy in the metastatic setting
	Patient relevance: The patient has received three lines of therapy, not four or more as required for this sub-study criterion.

	Patient eligibility: not included
inclusion criterion 9: Must have received prior trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1
	Patient relevance: The patient has received prior trastuzumab, but there is no mention of pertuzumab or T-DM1, so there is not enough information to determine if she meets this criterion.
	Evident sentences: [1]
	Patient eligibility: not enough information
exclusion criterion 0: Known, untreated brain metastasis. Patients with signs or symptoms of brain metastasis must have a CT or MRI performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization to specifically exclude the presence of radiographically-detected brain metastases
	Patient relevance: The patient note does not mention any brain metastases, and the presence of untreated brain metastases is typically a significant clinical detail that would be noted if present. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the patient does not have this condition.
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 1: History of uncontrolled seizures within 6 months of randomization
	Patient relevance: There is no mention of seizures or any related conditions in the patient note. Given the specificity and severity of uncontrolled seizures, it is unlikely that such information would be omitted if it were true.
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 2: History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation
	Patient relevance: The patient note does not mention any history of allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation. This is a specific medical history that would likely be documented if it had occurred.
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 3: History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease
	Patient relevance: The patient has experienced cardiotoxicity in the past but has recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension as mentioned in the note. This does not meet the criterion of 'clinically significant cardiovascular disease' as it is controlled and not currently significant.
	Evident sentences: [6]
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 4: Clinically-significant pulmonary compromise, including a requirement for supplemental oxygen use to maintain adequate oxygenation
	Patient relevance: There is no mention of pulmonary compromise or the need for supplemental oxygen in the patient note. Such conditions would typically be documented due to their impact on patient management.
	Patient eligibility: not excluded
exclusion criterion 5: Any condition that would be a contraindication to receiving trastuzumab as described in the approved local label or a condition that would prevent treatment with the physician's choice of chemotherapy
	Patient relevance: The patient has previously received trastuzumab as part of her treatment, indicating no contraindications to its use. There is no mention of any conditions that would prevent treatment with the physician's choice of chemotherapy.
	Evident sentences: [1]

 system promt:You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. You will be given a patient note, a clinical trial, and the patient eligibility predictions for each criterion.
Your task is to output two scores, a relevance score (R) and an eligibility score (E), between the patient and the clinical trial.
First explain the consideration for determining patient-trial relevance. Predict the relevance score R (0~100), which represents the overall relevance between the patient and the clinical trial. R=0 denotes the patient is totally irrelevant to the clinical trial, and R=100 denotes the patient is exactly relevant to the clinical trial.
Then explain the consideration for determining patient-trial eligibility. Predict the eligibility score E (-R~R), which represents the patient's eligibility to the clinical trial. Note that -R <= E <= R (the absolute value of eligibility cannot be higher than the relevance), where E=-R denotes that the patient is ineligible (not included by any inclusion criteria, or excluded by all exclusion criteria), E=R denotes that the patient is eligible (included by all inclusion criteria, and not excluded by any exclusion criteria), E=0 denotes the patient is neutral (i.e., no relevant information for all inclusion and exclusion criteria).
Please output a JSON dict formatted as Dict{"relevance_explanation": Str, "relevance_score_R": Float, "eligibility_explanation": Str, "eligibility_score_E": Float}.,
 user_prompt: Here is the patient note:
0. Emma, a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
1. She had previously received three lines of systemic treatment for her metastatic disease, including trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
2. Sarah's most recent scans showed progression of her liver metastases, and her oncologist was considering new treatment options.
3. She had an ECOG performance status of 1 and adequate organ function, including a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
4. Sarah's tumor tissue from a recent liver biopsy was available for biomarker analysis.
5. She had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and had not received any investigational drugs in the last two weeks.
6. Sarah had experienced some cardiotoxicity during her previous treatments but had recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension.
7. She had no active infections or other severe uncontrolled medical conditions.
8. Sarah was interested in exploring clinical trial options that could potentially offer new treatment combinations for her HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
9. The patient will provide informed consent, and will comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues.

Here is the clinical trial description:
