Her medical history was unremarkable, with no prior use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. She maintained an ECOG performance status of 0 and had normal organ function based on recent laboratory tests. Sarah was not pregnant or breastfeeding and agreed to use appropriate contraception methods. She had not participated in any other clinical trials or received investigational treatments in the past four weeks. Sarah did not have any known immunodeficiency, and she had not received any live vaccines in the past 30 days. Her hepatitis B and C tests were negative, and she had no history of HIV infection. Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of participating in a clinical trial investigating immunotherapy for high-risk DCIS. The trial involved intralesional injections of mRNA-2752, either alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, followed by surgical removal of the lesion. Sarah expressed interest in learning more about the study and its potential benefits for patients with her type of DCIS.",

Her tumor was found to be estrogen receptor-positive with an Allred score of 7 and HER2-negative. The primary tumor measured 2.5 cm in size and was considered operable. Sarah had no history of prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or endocrine therapy for her current breast cancer. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no other malignancies in the past 3 years. Sarah's body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 31 kg/m2, placing her in the obese category. Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1, indicating she was ambulatory and able to carry out light work. Laboratory tests showed normal liver function with total bilirubin, AST, and ALT within institutional limits. Her creatinine clearance was 65 mL/min/1.73 m2. A core needle biopsy of the tumor was performed, providing sufficient tissue samples for correlative studies. Sarah had no known allergies or hypersensitivity to anastrozole or letrozole. Given her postmenopausal status and the characteristics of her breast cancer, Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors before surgery.",

Sarah learned that participants would be randomly assigned to apply either calcipotriene ointment or a placebo (Vaseline) to their upper extremities twice daily for the period between core biopsy and surgical removal of their breast lesion. The study would assess changes in immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and monitor for any treatment-related adverse events.

She had previously undergone two rounds of chemotherapy for her metastatic disease, but her cancer continued to progress. Sarah's oncologist informed her about a clinical trial studying a new drug called LY2880070 in combination with gemcitabine for patients with advanced solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer. Sarah's ECOG performance status was 1, and she had an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks. Her most recent scans showed measurable tumor lesions according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Sarah's organ function tests were within normal limits, and she had no history of central nervous system metastases. She was not pregnant or nursing and had no other active cancers within the past year. Sarah's ECG showed a QTcB interval within the normal range, and she had not received any investigational drugs in the past 21 days. The trial involved taking oral doses of LY2880070 and receiving intravenous gemcitabine during 21-day cycles. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy in patients like Sarah with advanced or metastatic cancer.",
