Her medical history was unremarkable, with no prior use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. She maintained an ECOG performance status of 0 and had normal organ function based on recent laboratory tests. Sarah was not pregnant or breastfeeding and agreed to use appropriate contraception methods.

Sarah did not have any known immunodeficiency, and she had not received any live vaccines in the past 30 days. Her hepatitis B and C tests were negative, and she had no history of HIV infection. Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of participating in a clinical trial investigating immunotherapy for high-risk DCIS. The trial involved intralesional injections of mRNA-2752, either alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, followed by surgical removal of the lesion. Sarah expressed interest in learning more about the study and its potential benefits for patients with her type of DCIS.",

        "raw":"Charlotte, a 62-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her liver. Her primary tumor was confirmed to be HER2-positive (IHC 3+) and hormone receptor-positive through histopathology. Sarah had previously received one line of chemotherapy for her metastatic disease but had not been treated with pertuzumab or any CDK4/6 inhibitors. Her most recent tumor evaluation, performed three weeks ago, showed measurable lesions according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Sarah's ECOG performance status was 1, and her left ventricular ejection fraction was 55% as measured by echocardiogram. Recent laboratory results showed adequate organ function, with normal liver enzymes, bilirubin, and creatinine levels. Her ECG revealed a QTcF interval of 440 msec and a resting heart rate of 72 bpm. Sarah had no history of serious cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or significant diabetic complications. She was not pregnant and agreed to use effective non-hormonal contraception during the study period. Sarah's oncologist discussed the potential benefits and risks of participating in a clinical trial comparing chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy in combination with dual HER2-targeted therapy for her type of breast cancer.",

Her tumor was classified as HER2-positive, with a size of 2.5 cm (T2) and no apparent lymph node involvement (N0). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing revealed a 3+ score for HER2 overexpression, confirming her HER2-positive status. Sarah's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was within the normal range as measured by an echocardiogram. Her laboratory results showed an absolute neutrophil count of 2.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 180 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal limits. Sarah had no history of cardiac disease, hypertension, or significant gastrointestinal disorders. She was post-menopausal and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of participating in a clinical trial investigating the use of preoperative trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of trastuzumab administered 4 to 14 days before surgery on disease-free survival compared to a placebo. Sarah learned that if she were to participate, she would be randomly assigned to receive either trastuzumab or a placebo infusion before her scheduled surgery, followed by standard post-operative adjuvant therapy.",
