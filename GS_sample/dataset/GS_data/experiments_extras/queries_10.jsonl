{"_id": "P_NCT02872025", "text": "Sarah, a 42-year-old woman, was recently diagnosed with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Her tumor was found to be hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive, measuring approximately 6 cm in size. Sarah had no history of other malignancies or autoimmune diseases. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no prior use of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. She maintained an ECOG performance status of 0 and had normal organ function based on recent laboratory tests. Sarah was not pregnant or breastfeeding and agreed to use appropriate contraception methods. She had not participated in any other clinical trials or received investigational treatments in the past four weeks. Sarah did not have any known immunodeficiency, and she had not received any live vaccines in the past 30 days. Her hepatitis B and C tests were negative, and she had no history of HIV infection. Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of participating in a clinical trial investigating immunotherapy for high-risk DCIS. The trial involved intralesional injections of mRNA-2752, either alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, followed by surgical removal of the lesion. Sarah expressed interest in learning more about the study and its potential benefits for patients with her type of DCIS."}

{"_id": "P_NCT02448420", "text": "Emma, a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman, was diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. She had previously received three lines of systemic treatment for her metastatic disease, including trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Sarah's most recent scans showed progression of her liver metastases, and her oncologist was considering new treatment options. She had an ECOG performance status of 1 and adequate organ function, including a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Sarah's tumor tissue from a recent liver biopsy was available for biomarker analysis. She had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and had not received any investigational drugs in the last two weeks. Sarah had experienced some cardiotoxicity during her previous treatments but had recovered, with no current signs of congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension. She had no active infections or other severe uncontrolled medical conditions. Sarah was interested in exploring clinical trial options that could potentially offer new treatment combinations for her HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer."}
{"_id": "P_NCT03740893", "text": "Ava, a 48-year-old woman, was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) six months ago. She had undergone six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but her most recent MRI scan showed residual disease with a tumor focus measuring 2.5 cm. Sarah's oncologist informed her about the PHOENIX trial, a phase IIa study investigating DNA damage response inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with chemotherapy-resistant TNBC. Sarah had no history of other malignancies in the past five years and was in good overall health with an ECOG performance status of 1. Her recent blood tests showed adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function. Sarah had no significant cardiovascular issues, autoimmune disorders, or recent major surgeries. She was post-menopausal due to chemotherapy-induced menopause and had her last menstrual period over a year ago. Sarah was not taking any medications that could interfere with the trial treatments, such as strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. She had recovered from the acute side effects of her previous chemotherapy, with only grade 1 fatigue remaining. Sarah was scheduled for definitive surgical treatment and was considered fit enough to undergo breast cancer surgery with curative intent. She was also deemed suitable for the mandatory pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies required by the trial protocol."}
{"_id": "P_NCT03315364", "text": "Olivia, a 54-year-old woman, was recently diagnosed with recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer. Her initial diagnosis was three years ago, and she had undergone surgery and radiation therapy at that time. Unfortunately, during a routine follow-up, imaging revealed metastatic lesions in her liver. Sarah's oncologist confirmed the recurrence through a biopsy, which showed hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. She had not received any chemotherapy for her metastatic disease. Sarah's last taxane treatment was over 18 months ago as part of her initial therapy. Currently, she has an ECOG performance status of 1 and experiences only mild fatigue. Sarah does not have any signs of neuropathy, and recent brain scans showed no evidence of central nervous system metastasis. Her oncologist has been discussing various treatment options with her, including potential clinical trials that might be suitable for her condition. Sarah is interested in exploring all available options to manage her recurrent and metastatic breast cancer effectively."}

She had previously undergone chemotherapy and targeted therapy, but her disease continued to progress. Recent genomic testing revealed a BRCA2 mutation in her tumor. Sarah's oncologist informed her about a phase II clinical trial studying the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in treating patients with advanced solid tumors and genomic instability. Sarah had an ECOG performance status of 1 and was able to perform most daily activities with some limitations. Her most recent lab results showed an ANC of 1,800/mcL, platelets of 120,000/mcL, and hemoglobin of 10 g/dL. Her liver function tests were within normal limits, with AST and ALT both at 2.0 times the upper limit of normal. Sarah had no history of autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiency disorders. She had completed her last round of chemotherapy six weeks ago and had recovered from its side effects. Sarah was not pregnant and agreed to use two forms of contraception throughout the study period. She had no known brain metastases and had not received any prior immunotherapy treatments. Sarah's oncologist discussed the potential risks and benefits of participating in the clinical trial, including the possibility of immune-related adverse events and the need for regular follow-up visits and assessments."}
{"_id": "P_NCT02583828", "text": "Maria, a 72-year-old woman, was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that was estrogen receptor-positive. She had previously undergone standard chemotherapy, but her disease had progressed. Maria's oncologist found that she had measurable disease according to RECIST criteria, and her ECOG performance status was 1. Blood tests revealed adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Maria had no history of other malignancies and did not have any uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions. Her metastases were limited to the bones and lungs, with no brain involvement. Given her age and previous treatment history, Maria's medical team was considering alternative treatment options that might be more suitable for her current condition. They were particularly interested in exploring hormone therapy combined with low-dose chemotherapy as a potential approach to manage her metastatic breast cancer while maintaining her quality of life."}

{"_id": "P_NCT01785420", "text": "Evelyn, a 60-year-old woman, was recently diagnosed with stage II breast cancer. Her tumor was classified as HER2-positive, with a size of 2.5 cm (T2) and no apparent lymph node involvement (N0). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing revealed a 3+ score for HER2 overexpression, confirming her HER2-positive status. Sarah's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was within the normal range as measured by an echocardiogram. Her laboratory results showed an absolute neutrophil count of 2.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 180 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and liver function tests within normal limits. Sarah had no history of cardiac disease, hypertension, or significant gastrointestinal disorders. She was post-menopausal and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Sarah's oncologist discussed various treatment options with her, including the possibility of participating in a clinical trial investigating the use of preoperative trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The trial aimed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of trastuzumab administered 4 to 14 days before surgery on disease-free survival compared to a placebo. Sarah learned that if she were to participate, she would be randomly assigned to receive either trastuzumab or a placebo infusion before her scheduled surgery, followed by standard post-operative adjuvant therapy."}
