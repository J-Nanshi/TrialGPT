Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III.

{"_id": "NCT02422641", "title": "Prospective Evaluation Of High-Dose Systemic Methotrexate In Patients With Breast Cancer And Leptomeningeal Metastasis", "text": "Summary: Management of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical need. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics, it penetrates the blood brain barrier, targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow, may penetrate bulky leptomeningeal disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast cancer, no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens. Thus, while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying degrees in cancer centers across the nation, this is more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II, prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Adults (male and female) age >18 \n\n Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 0-1 (see Appendix I) \n\n Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer of the following subtype: \n\n TRIPLE NEGATIVE (ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative disease).

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics, it penetrates the blood brain barrier, targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow, may penetrate bulky leptomeningeal disease, and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast cancer, no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens. Thus, while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying degrees in cancer centers across the nation, this is more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II, prospective study will evaluate systemic, intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis."}}

The study drug is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in healthy postmenopausal women to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Since it is not approved in women with DCIS, its use in this study is experimental. This study will also look at whether taking the study drug causes any significant or undesirable side effects in women with DCIS. The researchers hope that this study will help them determine if taking the study drug is safe in women taking DCIS and if it can possibly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women with DCIS."}}

Eighty-four patients will be enrolled at Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) sites and will be randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with pembrolizumab and carboplatin (n=56, Arm A) or carboplatin alone (n=28, Arm B) until documented disease progression. Patients randomized to Arm B may cross-over following progression to pembrolizumab with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm Bx). Patients may have received any number of prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients in Arm A will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV and carboplatin area under curve (AUC) 5 IV every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles followed by maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks if stable or responding disease. Patients in Arm B will be treated with carboplatin AUC 5 IV every 3 weeks until progression, whereupon they may cross-over to pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm Bx). An interim analysis for futility will be performed after 18 patients are enrolled into Arm B to allow early stopping of that trial arm for lack of efficacy.

FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs used in endocrine therapy either lower the amount of estrogen made by the body or blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow.

Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. \n\n Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection). \n\n Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormality including any of the following: \n\n History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry. \n\n Documented cardiomyopathy. \n\n Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) detected during screening. \n\n History of cardiac failure, significant/symptomatic bradycardia, Long QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome or any of the following: \n\n Known risk to prolong the QT interval or induce Torsade's de Pointes. \n\n Uncorrected hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia. \n\n Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) >160 mmHg or <90 mmHg. \n\n Bradycardia (heart rate <50 at rest), by ECG or pulse. \n\n On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.: unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF >450 screening ECG (based on a mean of 3 ECGs). \n\n History of hypersensitivity to ribociclib or any of its components. \n\n HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. \n\n Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of ribociclib is not established in pregnant women. For this reason and because CDK4/6 agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational agent(s). Registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled in the study. WOCBP is defined as follows: Any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35 mIU/ml). Even women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP. \n\n Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include: \n\n Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception \n\n Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment \n\n Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. \n\n In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

These participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. \n\n Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of ribociclib is not established in pregnant women. For this reason and because CDK4/6 agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational agent(s). Registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled in the study. WOCBP is defined as follows: Any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35 mIU/ml). Even women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP. \n\n Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include: \n\n Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception \n\n Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment \n\n Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. \n\n In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

{"_id": "NCT03344965", "title": "Olaparib In Metastatic Breast Cancer", "text": "Summary: This research study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer.~Metastatic means that the cancer has spread beyond the breast. In addition, through genetic testing of the blood or tumor, an altered gene has been found that suggests the tumor may not be able to repair its genetic material (DNA) when it becomes damaged.~This aspect of the cancer may cause it to be more sensitive - that is, more effectively killed by certain types of drugs such as the study agent being evaluated in this trial, Olaparib.~Olaparib is a type of drug known as a PARP inhibitor. Some types of breast cancer and ovarian cancer share some basic features that make them sensitive to similar treatments. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to treat metastatic breast cancer.~This study will evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in one of the other genes that function with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to repair damaged DNA .This mutation may have been inherited from a parent, or may have developed only in the tumor.~This study will also evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that was acquired by the tumor, but not inherited.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease, either biopsy proven or with unequivocal evidence of metastatic disease by physical examination or radiological study. \n\n Cohorts 1 and 2: Documented germline (Cohort 1) or somatic mutation or homozygous deletion (Cohort 2) in one of the DNA repair genes listed below that is deleterious or suspected to be deleterious, and no germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

In addition, through genetic testing of the blood or tumor, an altered gene has been found that suggests the tumor may not be able to repair its genetic material (DNA) when it becomes damaged.~This aspect of the cancer may cause it to be more sensitive - that is, more effectively killed by certain types of drugs such as the study agent being evaluated in this trial, Olaparib.~Olaparib is a type of drug known as a PARP inhibitor. Some types of breast cancer and ovarian cancer share some basic features that make them sensitive to similar treatments. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to treat metastatic breast cancer.~This study will evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in one of the other genes that function with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to repair damaged DNA .This mutation may have been inherited from a parent, or may have developed only in the tumor.~This study will also evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that was acquired by the tumor, but not inherited."}}

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy with or without olaparib may work better in treating patients with inflammatory breast cancer.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients must have inflammatory breast cancer without distant metastases.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen vaccine will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic invasive triple negative breast cancer.

Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum 4 cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks are preferred. Fine-needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases, and lavage samples are not acceptable. \n\n No prior therapy for metastatic TNBC. Patients who have received taxane-based adjuvant therapy are required to have a disease-free interval of at least 12 months after completion of taxane therapy. \n\n Age >= 18 years.

Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply: \n\n Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). \n\n Women >= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). \n\n The effects of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab and neoantigen vaccine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and through 180 days after completion of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. \n\n Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. \n\n Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are eligible provided they have a negative viral load, CD4 count > 250, and are on a stable antiretroviral regimen. \n\n Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with impaired decision-making capacity who have a close caregiver or legal guardian are also eligible with the consent of the caregiver/guardian. \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Patients who are not considered to be candidates for carboplatin + gemcitabine for first line therapy of their metastatic triple negative breast cancer are not eligible. \n\n Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy (to more than 30% of the bone marrow), or biologic therapy within 30 days (42 days for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study. \n\n Patients who have received prior immunotherapy for metastatic disease. \n\n Patients who have not recovered from grade >= 2 adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria. \n\n Patients with grade >= 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the study physician. \n\n Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an investigational agent within the last 30 days. \n\n Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 6 months prior to study entry or within 30 days of receiving durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. \n\n Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. \n\n Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable. \n\n Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion: \n\n Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids or local steroid injections (e.g. intra-articular injection) \n\n Systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid \n\n Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan premedication). \n\n Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. \n\n History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to vaccines, such as anaphylaxis, hives or respiratory difficulty. \n\n Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >= 470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart). \n\n Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, evidence of any acute or chronic viral illness or disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. \n\n Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7 days before study entry. \n\n Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. \n\n History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease. \n\n History of active primary immunodeficiency. \n\n Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen [HBsAg] result), or hepatitis C.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen vaccine will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer."}}

{"_id": "NCT03635632", "title": "C7R-GD2.CART Cells for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma and Other GD2 Positive Cancers (GAIL-N)", "text": "Summary: This study is for patients with neuroblastoma, sarcoma, uveal melanoma, breast cancer, or another cancer that expresses a substance on the cancer cells called GD2. The cancer has either come back after treatment or did not respond to treatment. Because there is no standard treatment at this time, patients are asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection.~The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.~We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our last clinical trial we made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2, a substance found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to 11 neuroblastoma patients. We saw that the cells did grow for a while, but started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think that if T cells are able to last longer they may have a better chance of killing GD2 positive tumor cells.~Therefore, in this study we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live longer. T cells need substances called cytokines to survive and the cells may not get enough cytokines after infusion. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.~In other studies using T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that it will allow the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively.~The GD2-C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.~The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on cancer.\nInclusion criteria: Procurement inclusion criteria: \n\n Evaluable neuroblastoma with persistent or relapsed disease \n\n Recurrent disease following completion of aggressive multi-drug frontline therapy. \n\n Progressive disease during aggressive multi-drug frontline therapy. \n\n Primary resistant/refractory disease (less than partial response by INRC) detected at the conclusion of at least 4 cycles of aggressive multi-drug induction chemotherapy on or according to a standard high-risk treatment protocol \n\n OR Relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma not responsive to standard treatment \n\n OR Patients diagnosed with GD2 positive metastatic uveal melanoma and progressed after at least one prior systemic treatment \n\n OR GD2 positive breast cancer with metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer currently progressive after at least two prior lines of therapy in the advanced setting.

We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.~In this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.~Investigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor.

We also hope to learn the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.~In this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor cells.~Investigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved by the FDA."}}

Given the relatively poor prognosis for these patients, this population is considered novel therapeutic as adjuvant treatment. Currently, capecitabine monotherapy could be beneficial to this group of patients according to CREATE-X trial results. The investigators are addressing the effect of anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab combined with capecitabine in patients with TNBC who did not get pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to capecitabine monotherapy."}}
