    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Fertile women were excluded if pregnant or lactating or if they were not using adequate contraception. \n\n Previous chemotherapy for breast cancer. \n\n history of other serious illness (e.g. congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, clinically significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders, uncontrolled serious infection, AIDS), had an organ allograft, severe gastrointestinal disorder, or other neoplasias (except for in situ cervical cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, or previous diagnosis of cancer with no evidence of disease for >10 years).",
