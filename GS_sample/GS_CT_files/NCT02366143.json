History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted \n\n Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus \n\n Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C \n\n Severe infection within 4 weeks prior to randomization \n\n Significant cardiovascular disease \n\n Illness or condition that interferes with the participant's capacity to understand, follow and/or comply with study procedures \n\n ",
    "brief_summary": "This randomized, open-label study evaluated the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in combination with carboplatin+paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab compared with treatment with carboplatin+paclitaxel+bevacizumab in chemotherapy-na\u00efve participants with Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A (Atezolizumab+Carboplatin+Paclitaxel), Arm B (Atezolizumab+Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+Bevacizumab), or Arm C (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+Bevacizumab).",
