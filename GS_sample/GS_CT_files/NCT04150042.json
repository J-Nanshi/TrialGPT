Oral and injectable contraceptives are not allowed. Barrier methods of birth control (e.g., diaphragm and spermicide, or condom and spermicide) are required. \n\n Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, and withdrawal) are not acceptable methods of contraception. \n\n Male participants: \n\n Unless the male is in a monogamous relationship with a female that does not have child-bearing potential, male subjects (even if surgically sterilized) must agree to do one of the following from the time of signing of the informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of melphalan: \n\n Practice effective barrier contraception, plus a second method of effective contraception. \n\n Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, and withdrawal) are not acceptable methods of contraception. \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "The clinical trial is a phase 1, single-arm trial that will evaluate the safety of the investigational treatment on metastatic cancer in patients who have an inherited, deleterious BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 genetic alteration. The investigational treatment will involve 2 cycles of a combination of intravenous melphalan, BCNU, low-dose I.V. ethanol, vitamin B12b, and vitamin C in association with autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion. A dose-escalation schedule will be employed for vitamin C.",
