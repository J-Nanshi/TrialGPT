In hematological malignancies LYRIC/Lugano will be used. \n\n Phase 2A inclusion criteria for these patients will remain similar to those used during Phase 1. \n\n Key ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Phase 1 \n\n Any prior Grade 4 immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) or Grade 3 imAE requiring steroid treatment (>10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose for more than 12 weeks) while receiving immunotherapy that has been documented within the 12 months prior to enrollment. \n\n Unresolved toxicity higher than Grade 1 CTCAE v 5 (or higher) attributed to any prior therapy/procedure at screening, except for alopecia. \n\n Prior history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with a monoclonal antibody \n\n Patients who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding \n\n Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within 14 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) before investigational enrollment (Day 1, Cycle 1 dosing) \n\n Patient with history of malignancy (other than the one for which he/she participates in the study or than basal cell carcinoma definitively resected, or other in situ cancers) - unless the patient has undergone curative therapy with no evidence of that disease for 3 years \n\n Patients currently receiving cancer therapy (ie, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, surgery, and/or tumor embolization) or expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study. \n\n Patients with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment (corticosteroids or other active immunosuppressive medications) within the past 6 months - with the exclusion of vitiligo, resolved asthma/atopia or alopecia areata; hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement. \n\n Known CNS metastases (unless clinically stable for at least 4weeks prior to enrollment and off steroids for at least 7 days- exceptions above for physiologic replacement doses of hydrocortisone) \n\n Myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA> Class II), unstable angina, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia within the last 6 months of screening \n\n Patient has history of or current HIV, Hepatitis B or C infection, even if not active and/or controlled \n\n Phase 2A ",
    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase 1/2a open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion trial in which IMT-009 will be administered by the intravenous (IV) route to participants with solid tumors or lymphomas.~The main goals of this study are to:~Find the recommended dose of IMT-009 that can be safely given to participants~Learn more about the side effects of IMT-009~Learn more about pharmacokinetics of IMT-009~Learn more about the effectiveness of IMT-009~Learn more about different pharmacokinetic biomarkers and how they might change in the presence of IMT-009",
