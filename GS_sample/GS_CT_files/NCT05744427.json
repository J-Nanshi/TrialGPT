    "brief_summary": "This is an open, multicenter study of stage Ia/Ib in Chinese subjects with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors. It is divided into dose escalation period and cohort expansion period. A total of 9 dose groups (Q3W on the first day of intravenous administration every three weeks) were designed in the dose escalation period. The initial dose was 1.0mg/kg, Q3W, and the observation period of DLT was 21 days. In the dose expansion phase, 5 cohorts were set up.",
