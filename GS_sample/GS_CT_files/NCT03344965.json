Patients with germline mutations in BRCA1/2 are NOT eligible for this study. (Cohort 2 only) \n\n Cohort 1a: germline PALB2 mutation \n\n -- The mutation must be identified through a CLIA-approved NGS panel. Mutations must be reviewed and confirmed by Dr. Tung to meet eligibility prior to registration. \n\n Cohort 2a: somatic mutation of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 \n\n -- The mutation must be identified through a CLIA-approved NGS panel. Mutations must be reviewed and confirmed by Dr. Tung to meet eligibility prior to registration. Documentation of absence of germline mutation in BRCA 1/2 is required. \n\n All deep (homozygous) deletions, frameshift mutations and truncating mutations in the genes listed above are eligible as well as missense variants in these genes that have previously been reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.

Platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is not permitted. \n\n History of prior anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin, epirubicin) and taxane-based (e.g. paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant / adjuvant or metastatic setting is preferred, but not required. \n\n Patients with hormone receptor-positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive) disease must have received and progressed on at least one endocrine therapy (adjuvant or metastatic), or have disease that the treating physician believes to be inappropriate for endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy must have been completed at least 7 days before study treatment. \n\n Prior radiation is allowed; radiation therapy must have been completed at least 21 days before study treatment. \n\n Prior treatment with FDA approved or investigational biologics (other than PARP inhibitors) and novel molecularly targeted therapies, including oral or IV formulations, shall not exclude patients from participation. \n\n For agents with ambiguous categorization, final determination of patient eligibility will be made by the Protocol Chair prior to enrollment. \n\n Prior PARP inhibitor use is not allowed for this study \n\n Age \u2265 18 years. \n\n ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky \u226560%, see Appendix A) Life expectancy \u226516 weeks \n\n Participants must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to registration as defined below: \n\n absolute neutrophil count \u22651,500/mcL \n\n white blood cells > 3,000/mcL \n\n platelets \u2265100,000/mcL \n\n hemoglobin \u2265 10.0 g/dL with no blood transfusions (packed red blood cells in the past 28 days is permitted) \n\n total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal \n\n AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u22642.5 \u00d7 institutional upper limit of normal \n\n Serum or plasma creatinine \u2264 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) \n\n --- OR \n\n creatinine clearance \u226551 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants \n\n Estimated creatinine clearance = (140-age [years]) x weight (kg) (x F)a serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 ---- a where F=0.85 for females and F=1 for males. \n\n Willingness to undergo biopsy. \n\n Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria: Disease outside the CNS is present; no clinical evidence of progression since completion of CNS-directed therapy; minimum of 2 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1 and recovery from significant (Grade \u22653) acute toxicity with no ongoing requirement for > 10mg of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other corticosteroid. NOTE: Patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to treatment. \n\n Both men and women are eligible for this study \n\n Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential.

    "brief_summary": "This research study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer.~Metastatic means that the cancer has spread beyond the breast. In addition, through genetic testing of the blood or tumor, an altered gene has been found that suggests the tumor may not be able to repair its genetic material (DNA) when it becomes damaged.~This aspect of the cancer may cause it to be more sensitive - that is, more effectively killed by certain types of drugs such as the study agent being evaluated in this trial, Olaparib.~Olaparib is a type of drug known as a PARP inhibitor. Some types of breast cancer and ovarian cancer share some basic features that make them sensitive to similar treatments. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to treat metastatic breast cancer.~This study will evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in one of the other genes that function with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to repair damaged DNA .This mutation may have been inherited from a parent, or may have developed only in the tumor.~This study will also evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that was acquired by the tumor, but not inherited.",
