    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Subjects with other malignant tumors in the past 5 years (except for the cured skin basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ). \n\n There is a third interstitial effusion (e.g., massive ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other methods. \n\n Inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, or other factors that affect drug administration and absorption. \n\n Received mitomycin C and nitrosoureas chemotherapy within 6 weeks before the first study drug administration. \n\n Any surgery (eg., major surgery for cancer), radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or molecular targeted therapy, biotherapy or other drug clinical trial within 4 weeks; received endocrine therapy within 2 weeks before the first study drug administration. \n\n Any concurrent use of immunosuppressant or systemic corticosteroid treatment to achieve immunosuppression purpose (dose of > 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent), and still in use within 2 weeks before the first study drug administration. \n\n History of autoimmune disease with the possibility of recurrence or active autoimmune disease; subjects with skin diseases without systematic treatment such as vitiligo, psoriasis, alopecia, or controlled type I diabetes treated with insulin can be included; asthma completely relieved in childhood without any intervention in adult can be included, subjects that requires medical intervention with bronchodilators for asthma cannot be included). \n\n History of immunodeficiency including seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other acquired or congenital immune-deficient disease, or organ transplantation. \n\n Cardiac disease including myocardial infarction within a minimum 6 months before the first study drug administration, severe or unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes \u2265II), or clinically significant supraventricular or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment/intervention. \n\n Subjects with known or suspected interstitiallung disease; \n\n Active hepatitis B (HBsAg positive and HBV DNA \u2265 500 IU / ml), hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody positive and HCV RNA higher than the detection limit of the analytical method), hepatic cirrhosis, or severe infections requiring antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal control. \n\n Unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade \u22641 at baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible at the discretion of the investigator and discussion with sponsor. \n\n Known history of severe allergy to study drug or its components, or allergy to humanized monoclonal antibody products (such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, etc.). \n\n The presence of other serious physical or mental disorders or abnormalities in laboratory tests that may increase the risk of study participation or interfere with study results, as well as patients deemed unsuitable for study participation by the investigator.",
