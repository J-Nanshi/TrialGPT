    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous therapy with Fulvestrant and/or Lapatinib; \n\n Patients with HER 2 overexpressing, either IHC 3+ or FISH +; \n\n Concurrent non study anti-cancer therapy ( \n\n Have unresolved or unstable, serious toxicity from prior administration \n\n Have malabsorption syndrome, \n\n Have a concurrent disease or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study participation, \n\n Have an active or uncontrolled infection; \n\n Have dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent; \n\n Have a known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or CHF; \n\n Receive concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participate in another clinical trial; \n\n Receive concurrent treatment with prohibited medications \n\n Used an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study medication; \n\n Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors or lapatinib or excipients.",
    "brief_summary": "Based on these results it can be envisioned that the majority of endocrine-responsive post-menopausal breast cancer patients will be treated with an AI as adjuvant therapy (front-line, switching or extending) and/or as first-line management of metastatic breast cancer.",
