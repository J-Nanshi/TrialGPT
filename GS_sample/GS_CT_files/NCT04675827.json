Whenever possible, two FFPE tumour blocks should be available (preferred). \n\n If a block cannot be provided, 25 unstained FFPE slides of 4 \u00b5m thickness from the pre-treatment tumour biopsy must be provided as an alternative. These slides must be freshly cut prior the shipment to the sponsor. \n\n In either case, the local pathologist must evaluate an H&E stained slide to ensure that the tumour surface is at least 4 mm\u00b2 and that tumour cellularity is \u226510%. \n\n Note: Tumour biopsy must be sent to the central research laboratory as soon as the patient is confirmed by the local investigator to be eligible for the study. \n\n Signed Informed Consent form (ICF) obtained prior to any study related procedure. \n\n Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including treatment and scheduled visits and examinations. \n\n Inclusion criterion applicable to FRANCE only: \n\n Affiliated to the French Social Security System. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Pregnant and/or lactating women. \n\n Bilateral invasive breast cancer. \n\n Evidence of metastatic breast cancer: all subjects must have had a CT/MRI scan of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis to rule out metastatic breast cancer prior to enrolment. FDG/PET-CT can be used as an alternative to replace all the exams above. A screening bone scan must have been done if ALP and/or corrected calcium levels were above the institutional upper limits at screening (if PET/CT was used as an alternative imaging exam, a bone scan and/or CT/MRI is not required). \n\n Subject with a significant medical, neuro-psychiatric, or surgical condition, currently uncontrolled by treatment, which, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with completion of the study. \n\n Previous exposure to any anti-HER2 treatment. \n\n Concomitant exposure to any investigational products as part of a clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrolment. \n\n Subject with second primary malignancies diagnosed \u2264 5 years before enrolment in the study.

    "brief_summary": "DECRESCENDO is a multicentre, open-label, dual-phase single-arm phase II de-escalation study evaluating neoadjuvant treatment with 12 administrations of weekly IV paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (or IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) combined with subcutaneous (SC) fixed dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (loading dose of 1200 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab, followed by 600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.~Surgery will be performed according to local guidelines in all subjects after neoadjuvant treatment.~After surgery, subjects who achieve a pCR (defined as pT0/Tis pN0) will receive adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for additional 14 cycles. Subjects with residual invasive disease will receive salvage adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, 3.6 mg/kg, IV every 3 weeks) for 14 cycles. In subjects whose residual invasive disease is classified per RCB score as \u22652, 3 to 4 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be administered, at the investigator's discretion, before the 14 cycles of T-DM1.~If histopathological analysis finds that the surgical specimen from a subject with residual disease is ER-positive and/or PR-positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy may be administered concomitantly with study treatment, at the investigator's discretion and according to local guidelines.~Adjuvant radiotherapy will be mandatory after breast-conserving surgery, whereas it will be performed according to local guidelines after mastectomy, and it will be administered concomitantly with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC in subjects who achieve a pCR, and concomitantly with T-DM1 in subjects with residual invasive disease (after anthracycline-based chemotherapy in subjects assigned to receive this treatment).",
