    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for > 2 years and which do not require ongoing treatment \n\n Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol \n\n Patients are not eligible if they have a known hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) or their components \n\n Prior use of WEE1 inhibitor or PKMYT1 inhibitor \n\n Patients with significant cardiac (including uncontrolled hypertension) or pulmonary disease, or active CNS disease or infection.

    "brief_summary": "This study is being done to answer the following questions:~Is the new drug, RP-6306, safe to use, and what effects does it have on cancer when given with standard treatment?~If there are specific biomarkers, do patients have an improved response to treatment compared to those without the biomarker?~This study is being done to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for this type of cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer.",
