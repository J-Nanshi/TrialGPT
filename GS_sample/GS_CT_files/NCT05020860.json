    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n At least 18 years of age, and legally able to provide informed consent. Both men and women are eligible. \n\n Histologically confirmed, invasive breast cancer. Tumor may be triple negative (as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines), HER2-positive (as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines), or high-risk estrogen receptor positive (as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines). \n\n To be considered high risk, at least 2 of the following criteria must be met: 1) histologic grade 3; 2) patient age less than 50; 3) ER Allred score < 6; 4) Ki-67 \u2265 30%. \n\n Tumors must be at least 2 cm by clinical exam or ultrasound \n\n ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 \n\n Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 the institutional lower limit of normal, as assessed by echocardiogram or Multigated Acquisition (MUGA )scan. \n\n Adequate organ function, as determined by the following parameters: \n\n Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1200/mm3 \n\n Platelets \u2265 100,000/mm3 \n\n Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL \n\n Total bilirubin \u2264 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless patient has Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome \n\n Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \u2264 2.5 x institutional ULN \n\n Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 1.5 x institutional ULN \n\n Serum creatinine \u2264 institutional ULN \n\n The participant, if of childbearing potential, is willing to use effective, non-hormonal contraception while on treatment. \n\n Participation in a concurrent clinical trial is permitted, with Principal Investigator approval. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of Stage IV disease \n\n Bilateral invasive breast cancer \n\n Inflammatory breast cancer \n\n Participants who are pregnant or lactating \n\n History of an excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to study entry \n\n Prior treatment with anthracyclines for any malignancy. \n\n Prior treatment for currently diagnosed breast cancer (i.e., endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation. \n\n History of cardiac disease that would preclude the use of drugs included in these treatment regimens. This includes, but is not limited to: \n\n Angina pectoris requiring the use of anti-anginal medication \n\n Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions \n\n Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication \n\n Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker \n\n Valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function \n\n Symptomatic pericarditis \n\n Documented cardiomyopathy \n\n History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF) \n\n Myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes, or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular function. \n\n Current HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection \n\n History of non-breast malignancies (with the exception of in situ cancers treated only by local excision, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to enrollment. \n\n Any other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude treatment with any of the treatment regimens or prevent required follow-up. \n\n Any psychiatric or addictive disorders, adverse social situations, or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting study requirements.",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether clinical response (the amount a tumor shrinks based on imaging or tumor measurements obtained by physical exam) predicts pathologic response (the amount of tumor remaining when surgery is performed) in patients with breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy prior to surgery.",
