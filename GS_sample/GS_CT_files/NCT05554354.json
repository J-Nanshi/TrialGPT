    "brief_summary": "This ComboMATCH phase II trial compares the usual treatment alone (fulvestrant) to using binimetinib plus the usual treatment in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and has an NF1 genetic change. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that binds to estrogen receptors in tumor cells, resulting in estrogen receptor destruction and decreased estrogen binding, which may inhibit the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells. Binimetinib is a targeted therapy that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The addition of binimetinib to fulvestrant in breast cancers with an NF1 genetic change could increase the percentage of tumors that shrink as well as lengthen the time that the tumors remain stable (without progression) as compared to fulvestrant alone.",
