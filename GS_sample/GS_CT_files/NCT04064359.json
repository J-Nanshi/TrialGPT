    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Subject is \u2265 18 years of age (at the time of signing the ICF) with non-curative recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors for which a standard therapy is not available or is no longer effective. \n\n Subject has histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumors. \n\n Subject has recurrent and/or metastatic cancer (based on most recently analyzed biopsy) defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines as negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+, or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required by local laboratory testing. \n\n Prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is allowed. \n\n Subject has tumor that is positive for CD205 antigen by IHC staining \n\n Subject has an ECOG performance status of 0-1. \n\n Subject has radiological documented measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 measurable lesion as per RECIST Version 1.1). \n\n Subject has adequate organ function \n\n Subject has adequate bone marrow function \n\n Subject understands and voluntarily signs an ICD prior to any study-related assessments/procedures are conducted. \n\n Subject is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Subject has received any chemotherapy within 21 days prior to inclusion in the study. \n\n Subject has received another investigational therapy within 28 days. \n\n Subject has not recovered from the acute toxic effects (CTCAE grade \u2264 1) of prior anticancer therapy, radiation, or major surgery/significant trauma (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the subject at the Investigator's discretion). \n\n Subject has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from major side effects. \n\n Subject has had radiotherapy \u2264 4 weeks prior to starting study drug. \n\n Subject has a history of, or current symptomatic brain metastasis. \n\n Subject has severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). \n\n Subject has any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization \n\n Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity or other contraindication to any excipients used in the manufacture of OBT076. \n\n Subject has significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months including unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention, significant cardiac arrhythmia, or NYHA class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure. \n\n Subject has a known history or current diagnosis of HIV infection, unless on triple antiviral treatment with undetectable viral load. \n\n Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate subject participation in the study (e.g., history of thromboembolic event, cardiac dysfunction, chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis). \n\n Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. \n\n Subject is a female of childbearing potential. \n\n Subject is lactating or breastfeeding.",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate OBT076, which is a drug that combines an antibody with an anti-cancer drug. This class of drugs are called Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC). Antibodies are normally produced in the human body by the immune system to fight infections but can be designed to target cancer cells and deliver an anti-cancer drug. OBT076 is composed of an antibody that targets the CD205 protein on cancer cells and delivers an anti-cancer drug which can kill them. OBT076 is an Investigational Drug, which means that it is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities to be prescribed by doctors for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. The use of OBT076 in this study is investigational.~This is a Phase I research study designed to look at several dose levels of the study drug to find the highest dose level that is safe and well-tolerated (does not cause unacceptable side effects), and to examine the effects of the study drug in a small group of research participants. The study will also look at the effectiveness of OBT076 as an anti-cancer therapy. Once the optimal dose is determined and safety is assessed, additional research participants will be treated at the optimal dose level to further evaluate safety and effectiveness.",
