Subjects with - previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically and clinically stable \n\n Active known or suspected autoimmune disease (exceptions include subjects that have vitiligo; type 1 diabetes mellitus or residual hypothyroidism due to an autoimmune condition that is treatable with hormone replacement therapy only; psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or another autoimmune skin condition that is managed without systemic therapy; or arthritis that is managed without systemic therapy beyond oral acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) \n\n Receipt of an organ allograft \n\n Evidence of any serious bacterial, viral, parasitic, or systemic fungal infections within the 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug \n\n Positive urine pregnancy test \n\n Known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or to any ingredient in the formulation or component of the container",
