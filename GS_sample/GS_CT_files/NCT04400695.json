For male subjects: should be sterilized surgically, or agree to use a medically approved contraceptive method during the study period and for 6 months after the end of the treatment period. Control subjects after the end of the treatment period according to the choice of control drugs to determine the length of contraception. \n\n Able to understand the study requirements and be willing and able to follow the study and follow-up procedures. \n\n Bone marrow function: \n\n hemoglobin \u22659g/dL; absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5\u00d7109/L; white blood cell count \u22653.0\u00d7109/L platelet \u2265100 \u00d7109/L; \n\n Liver function (according to the normal value of the clinical trial center) : \n\n serum total bilirubin \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and Alkaline phosphatase\uff08ALP\uff09 were \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN in the absence of liver metastasis, and ALT, AST and Alkaline phosphatase(ALP) were \u22645 \u00d7 ULN in the presence of liver metastasis \n\n Renal function (according to the normal value of the clinical trial center) : \n\n serum creatinine \u22641.5\u00d7ULN, or calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula, the creatinine clearance rate (CrCl) \u226560 mL/min; \n\n Cardiac function: \n\n American New York college of cardiology (NYHA) grade < 3; left ventricular ejection fraction \u226550%; \n\n Breast cancer subjects diagnosed by histology and / or cytology are currently at a locally advanced or metastatic stage and cannot be radically removed; \n\n The low expression of HER2 confirmed by the IHC and FISH results of the central laboratory (defined as: IHC 2+ and no amplification of FISH); the subject can provide a specimen of the primary or metastatic tumor site (paraffin wax) for HER2 detection Block, paraffin-embedded section or fresh tissue section can be used); \n\n Previous use of anthracycline drugs; \n\n Received 1 or 2 systemic chemotherapy treatments after relapse / metastasis. Subjects who relapsed during adjuvant chemotherapy or within 12 months after the end of adjuvant chemotherapy were considered to have failed first-line chemotherapy after relapse / metastasis. \n\n Hormone receptors are negative or positive. Hormone receptor-positive subjects need to progress after receiving endocrine therapy after relapse / metastasis or relapse after less than 2 years. Patients who are not suitable for endocrine therapy can be included in this study after undergoing chemotherapy treatment (first-line or second-line); \n\n The imaging evidence confirmed by the investigator that the tumor disease progressed during or after the most recent treatment is required; \n\n There has been no diagnosis of HER2 positive (HER2 IHC 3+ or FISH amplification) \n\n Have not used drugs targeting HER2 (including antibodies, small molecule Tyrosine kinase inhibitor\uff08TKIs\uff09 and antibody drug conjugates). \n\n According to the RECIST 1.1 standard, there is at least one measurable lesion. \n\n ",
