    "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2 trial. The phase 1b part of the trial aims to determine the RP2D of elacestrant when administered in combination with alpelisib, everolimus, palbociclib, and ribociclib. The Phase 2 part of the trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the various combinations in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",
