    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of multiple 4th generation CAR-T cells targeting Her2, GD2, and CD44v6 surface antigen in breast cancer. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the activities of the multi-CAR T cells and their persistency in the patients.",
