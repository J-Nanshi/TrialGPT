Systematic sampling is defined as removal of at least one representative lymph node at specified levels. MLND entails resection of all lymph nodes at those same levels. For a right thoracotomy, sampling or MLND is required at levels 4 and 7 and for a left thoracotomy, levels 5 and/or 6 and 7. Exceptions will be granted if there is clear documentation in the operative report or in a separately submitted addendum by the surgeon of exploration of the required lymph node areas, the participant will be considered eligible if no lymph nodes are found in those areas; if participants have documented N2 disease in one level (per the UICC/AJCC staging system, 7th edition; Detterbeck et al. 2009), not all levels need to be sampled; if the preoperative staging imaging results (contrast computed tomography [CT] and positron emission tomography [PET] scans) do not suggest evidence of disease in the mediastinum, the participant will be considered eligible if N2 nodal sampling is not performed per surgeon's decision \n\n Eligible to receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen \n\n Adequate hematologic and end-organ function \n\n Women who are not postmenopausal (>/=12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of cisplatin-based chemotherapy \n\n inclusion criteria for Randomized Phase - Women who are not postmenopausal (>/=12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of atezolizumab or BSC \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of 16 cycles (1 cycle duration=21 days) of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) treatment compared with best supportive care (BSC) in participants with Stage IB-Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, as measured by disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by the investigator and overall survival (OS). Participants, after completing up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab for 16 cycles or BSC.",
