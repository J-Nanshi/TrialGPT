    "brief_summary": "The international treatment guidelines now include recommendations for the use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with hormone agents for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative ABC as the first-line standard therapy in endocrine sensitive patients.~Nevertheless, it is generally thought that chemotherapy is associated with greater and earlier tumor response, especially in case of high burden of disease. In a retrospective analysis of real-world clinical practice (2002-2012) from US, only 60% of patients initiated ET as the first treatment following metastatic diagnosis . In the real-life world of China, a large number of HR+/HER2- ABC patients with non-visceral crisis also received chemotherapy in first-line treatment, even though the ORR is similar compared with CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy. Zhejiang Cancer Hospital retrospective analysis of 5 cases of advanced breast cancer first-line use of Ibance + ET, they were evaluated within 50 days (from 27days to 50days).~Based on the early response time observed in real-world data mentioned above, it is proposed a prospective study to further observe the tumor reduction rate in real-world, including to identify the time of patient symptom improvement according to the quality of life scale.",
