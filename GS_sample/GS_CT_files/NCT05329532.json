Patients in the SCCHN neoadjuvant cohort must have both a fresh pre-treatment biopsy and agree to have their resected tumour analysed. \n\n Patient is male or female and at least 18 years of age. \n\n Patient has a life expectancy of more than 6 months. \n\n Patient has an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. \n\n Patient has adequate organ function as determined by the following laboratory values: \n\n Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5 x 10^9/L \n\n Platelet count \u2265100 x 10^9/L \n\n Haemoglobin >90 g/L (>5.6 mmol/L) \n\n Lymphocytes \u22651 x 10^9/L \n\n Serum creatinine \u22641.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) \n\n Serum total bilirubin \u22641.5 x ULN (an exception for patients with Gilbert's syndrome may be granted after discussion with the Sponsor) \n\n Serum transaminases (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase) \u22642.5 x ULN or \u22645.0 x ULN if liver metastases are present. \n\n Patient must be able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure.

    "brief_summary": "The main objectives of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability, immunological activity, and preliminary efficacy of the Modi-1/Modi-1v vaccine, both as monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab (where these are standard of care in a non-neoadjuvant setting), in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced/unresectable human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC).~Modi-1 will also be investigated in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with SCCHN undergoing curative intent surgical resection in combination with pembrolizumab versus the Modi-1 alone.",
