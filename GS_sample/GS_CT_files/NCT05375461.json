    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase III, a randomized, double-blind, parallel , multi-center trail to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB3616 capsules plus fulvestrant compared to placebo plus fulvestrant in participants with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer. Approximately 287 women will be randomized to either TQB3616 plus fulvestrant or TQB3616-matching placebo plus fulvestrant. Randomization will follow a 2:1 randomization ratio,the experimental is 191; the Placebo Comparator is 96.",
