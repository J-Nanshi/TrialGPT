Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be \u226555% for patients receiving anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapy ; \n\n Liver and kidney function: serum creatinine \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal; AST and ALT \u22643 times the upper limit of normal; total bilirubin \u22641.5 times the upper limit of normal, or \u22642.5 times the upper limit of normal when the patient has Gilbert's syndrome ; \n\n Bone marrow function: neutrophils\u22651.5\u00d7109/L, platelets\u2265100\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin\u226590g/L; \n\n Able to comply with outpatient treatment, laboratory monitoring and necessary clinical visits during the study period; \n\n Subjects have the ability to understand, agree and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for the study prior to initiating any protocol-related procedures; subjects have the ability to express consent (if applicable). \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Advanced and/or inoperable patients with distant metastasis confirmed by imaging evidence or pathology; \n\n Other malignant tumors have occurred in the past 5 years, except for skin cancers of cured cervical carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma; \n\n Pregnant or breastfeeding women; patients with childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to take effective contraceptive measures; \n\n The molecular status of ER/PR and HER2 and Ki67 cannot be determined; \n\n Patients with CNS metastases or > grade 1 peripheral neuropathy; \n\n Severe cardiovascular disease: Grade II or higher myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction, poorly controlled arrhythmias (including QTc interval \u2265 470 ms); Grade III-IV cardiac insufficiency according to NYHA criteria, or cardiac ultrasound indicating a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <50%; \n\n Patients with hypertension that cannot be reduced to the normal range after antihypertensive medication (systolic blood pressure>140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure>90 mmHg); \n\n Received major surgical operations or suffered severe traumatic injury, fracture or ulcer within 4 weeks of enrollment; \n\n Patients with severe myelosuppression at screening; \n\n Patients with severe liver dysfunction (Child's Class III) or renal dysfunction at screening ; \n\n Arterial/venous thrombotic events such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischemic attack, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, that occurred within 6 months before randomization; \n\n Patients with hypersensitivity to any of the components of albumin paclitaxel, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab; \n\n Patients with psychiatric disorders; \n\n Subjects who are participating in another clinical study or whose first dose was administered less than 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives of the study drug) from the end of the previous clinical study (last dose) ; \n\n The investigator judges other situations that may affect the clinical research and the judgment of the research results and are not suitable for inclusion in the research.",
    "brief_summary": "Studies on postoperative adjuvant albumin paclitaxel in domestic breast cancer patients are less reported, especially in large samples, and more studies focus more on the safety and tolerability of albumin paclitaxel use. Head-to-head studies of white violet and docetaxel are not supported by data at this time, but some studies have shown that docetaxel-induced long-term Other adverse effects such as myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions can have a serious impact on quality of life. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the efficacy and safety of albumin paclitaxel and docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in a large randomized controlled trial, and to further analyse the efficacy and safety of albumin paclitaxel in combination with chemotherapy for postoperative breast cancer in different subtypes of breast cancer patients, in order to obtain more realistic data and provide new treatment options for breast cancer patients.",
