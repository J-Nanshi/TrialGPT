    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Prior treatment with tucatinib, afatinib, trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a), or any other investigational anti-HER2, anti-EGFR, or HER2 TKI agent. Prior treatment with lapatinib or neratinib within 12 months of starting study treatment (except in cases where they were given for \u226421 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity). Prior treatment with pyrotinib for recurrent of mBC (except in cases where pyrotinib was given for \u226421 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity). \n\n CNS Exclusion - Based on screening contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subjects must not have any of the following: \n\n Any untreated brain lesions >2 cm in size \n\n Ongoing use of corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a total daily dose of >2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent). \n\n Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy \n\n Known or concurrent leptomeningeal disease as documented by the investigator \n\n Poorly controlled generalized or complex partial seizures",
    "brief_summary": "This study is being done to see if tucatinib with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) works better than T-DM1 alone to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery.~Patients in this study will be randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill with no medicine). This is a blinded study, so neither patients nor their doctors will know whether a patient gets tucatinib or placebo. All patients in the study will get T-DM1, a drug that is often used to treat this cancer.~Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills or placebo pills two times every day. Patients will get T-DM1 injections from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.",
