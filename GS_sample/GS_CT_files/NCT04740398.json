Patients with primary platinum refractory disease are excluded \n\n Cohort 2: Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer \n\n Based on most recently analyzed biopsy or other pathological specimens, TNBC was confirmed histologically or cytologically \n\n Patients have received at least 2 previous systemic chemotherapy regimens for local advanced/metastasis disease. If the patients in the early phase develop into unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease within 12 months after adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the regimens will be regarded as one of the previous systemic chemotherapy regimens \n\n Cohort 3: Patients with other advanced solid tumor types who failed from standard therapy or no standard therapy exists or intolerant to the existing treatment, such as: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Non-triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, colon cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and so on \n\n Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1 \n\n At least 1 measurable tumor lesion according to RECIST v1.1 \n\n Archived tumor tissue samples available or fresh tumor biopsy samples available (they are optional in Phase Ia and mandatory in Ib) \n\n The time window from the last administration of previous anti-tumor therapy to the first administration of CBP-1008 in this study was at least 28 days.
