    "brief_summary": "This clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation and cohort expansion study to determine the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.~The study will be conducted in 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and a cohort expansion phase (Part 2). In Part 1 of the study, subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts treated with successively higher doses of FLX475 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. In Part 2 of the study, subjects will be initially enrolled in Stage 1 of parallel expansion cohorts of FLX475 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab.",
