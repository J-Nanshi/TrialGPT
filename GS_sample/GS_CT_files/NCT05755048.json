Male patients must agree to avoid sexual intercourse, or they and/or any female partners of childbearing potential must take a medically acceptable and effective contraceptive measure, such as double barrier methods, condoms, oral or injectable contraceptives, intra-uterine devices during and after the study and within at least 3 months after the last dose of FS-1502 or within at least 4 months after the last dose of T-DM1; \n\n Be able to understand and voluntarily sign the written Informed Consent Form (ICF). \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients that meet any of the following conditions shall not be included in this clinical study: \n\n Patients who have received chemotherapy, small molecule targeted drug therapy, radiotherapy, etc. within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) before administration or who have received major surgical treatment and tumor immunotherapy within 4 weeks before administration or who have received large molecule monoclonal antibody drugs for cancer treatment within 21 days before administration. \n\n Patients who have participated in other clinical studies within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) before administration. \n\n Patients who have been previously treated with anti-HER2 ADCs for metastatic diseases. \n\n Patients with known hypersensitivity or delayed type hypersensitivity to certain ingredients of T-DM1 or similar drugs, or with known contraindications for the use of T-DM1. \n\n Patients with pia maters, spinal cords, brainstem and brain parenchymal metastases; such patients are allowed to be enrolled if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n Patients who have received local treatment and the lesions are stable for more than 6 months; \n\n Patients who have no clinical symptoms and don't need glucocorticoid therapy or other dehydration treatment, and have a stable dose of an antiepileptic drug, if applicable. \n\n Patients with a large quantity of clinically uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites (within 2 weeks prior to the first dose). \n\n Unresolved toxic reactions from previous anti-tumor therapy (> NCI-CTCAE 5.0 Grade 1); however, alopecia, neurotoxicity or other toxicity that has converted to chronic and returned to NCI-CTCAE 5.0 Grade \u2264 2, and does not affect the safety of the patient as assessed by the Investigator are allowed to be enrolled. \n\n History of non-infectious interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonia, current ILD/pneumonia, or imaging suggestive of suspected ILD/pneumonia at screening. \n\n Subjects with corneal epithelial lesions (except mild punctate keratopathy), or other ocular diseases that affect the evaluation of ocular toxicity after the investigational product administration, or unwilling to stop wearing corneal contact lenses during the study. \n\n Patients on medications that prolong the QTc interval (mainly Classes Ia, Ic, III anti- arrhythmia medications) or with risk factors for prolonging the QTc interval, such as uncorrectable hypokalemia, inherited long QT syndrome; potential medications for prolonging the QTc interval are presented in Appendix 7. \n\n Cardiac function and diseases that meet one of the following conditions: \n\n Mean QTc > 450 ms for males and mean QTc > 470 ms for females averaged from 3 results of 12-lead ECG measurements using the QTc formula of the ECG instrument at the study site during the screening period; \n\n New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification \u2265 Class 2 congestive heart failure; \n\n Clinically significant arrhythmia (Grade \u2265 2); \n\n History of myocardial infarction or severe arteriovenous thrombotic events within 6 months. \n\n Pregnant or breastfeeding women. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to any excipients of FS-1502. \n\n Active infection requiring systemic therapy. \n\n Active hepatitis B (positive for HBV surface antigen and detected with HBV DNA > 1000 IU/mL or meeting the diagnostic criteria for active hepatitis B infection at the study site) or hepatitis C (positive for HCV RNA) and human immunodeficiency viral infection (HIV positive). \n\n Any other malignancy diagnosed within 5 years prior to the study, except for early malignancies (carcinoma in situ) that have undergone radical treatment, such as adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ. \n\n Any other diseases or conditions considered clinically significant by the investigator that could affect protocol compliance or affect the patient's ability to sign the ICF.",
