Premenopausal or perimenopausal female patients must be willing to receive LHRHa treatment during the study period. \n\n According to the RECIST 1.1 standard, patients can have: a) measurable lesions; b) without measurable lesions, unmeasurable osteolytic or mixed (osteolytic + osteogenic) bone lesions. c) Unmeasurable lesions. \n\n The main organs are functioning normally, that is, they meet the following standards: \n\n The standard of routine blood examination should meet: \n\n Hb\u226580 g/L; ANC\u22651.5\u00d7109 /L; PLT\u226575\u00d7109 /L; \n\n The biochemical inspection shall meet the following standards: \n\n TBIL\u22641.5\u00d7ULN (upper limit of normal value); ALT and AST\u22642.5\u00d7ULN; if there is liver metastasis, ALT and AST\u22645\u00d7ULN; Serum creatinine \u22641.5\u00d7ULN, creatinine clearance \u226550ml/min (based on Cockroft and Gault formula); \n\n Heart color Doppler ultrasound Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550%. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients who have previously received CDK4/6 inhibitor drug therapy. \n\n T-DM1 treats patients. \n\n Female patients during pregnancy or lactation. \n\n Suffer from serious concomitant diseases, such as infectious diseases; there are many factors that affect the oral and absorption of drugs. \n\n Patients considered by the investigator to be unsuitable to participate in this study.",
