    "brief_summary": "This trial will look at a drug called SGN-STNV to find out whether it is safe for patients with solid tumors. It will study SGN-STNV to find out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study how well SGN-STNV works to treat solid tumors.~The study will have two parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SGN-STNV should be given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SGN-STNV is and if it works to treat certain types of solid tumors.",
