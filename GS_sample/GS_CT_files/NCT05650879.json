    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test ELVN-002 in people with cancers that have an abnormal HER2 gene. The main question the trial aims to answer is if ELVN-002 is safe and tolerable at different doses. A second main question is to evaluate the concentration of ELVN-002 in the blood at different doses and to see how this correlates with safety and see how the concentration of drug changes over time. The third main question is to see if ELVN-002 works to shrink cancers that have HER2 genetic abnormalities, particularly non-small cell lung cancer.",
