    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous palliative radiotherapy to potentially biopsy-able lesion \n\n Active symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases \n\n Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation \n\n Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures",
    "brief_summary": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is biologically aggressive and has limited systemic treatment options, often compounded by treatment resistance.~Cell state transitions, e.g. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) govern cancer cell behaviour.~The investigators hypothesize that by inducing change in cell state change, TNBC cells that have manifested taxane-resistance will be more sensitized to subsequent chemotherapy.",
