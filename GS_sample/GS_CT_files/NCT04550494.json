If avoidable, the lesion for biopsy should not be selected as a target lesion for RECIST measurements \n\n The effects of talazoparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 7 months after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential and pregnant partners who are treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 4 months after completion of talazoparib administration \n\n Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules.

The time and treatment between the prior PARP inhibitor and protocol initiation must be documented \n\n All patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on prior therapy \n\n Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer must have castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL [1.74 nmol/L]) \n\n Patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR) prostate cancer and mutations in either BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM should continue to receive anti-AR therapy \n\n ",

Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events \n\n Patients who have had prior treatment with talazoparib are ineligible \n\n Patients who have had prior monoclonal antibody therapy must have completed that therapy >= 6 weeks (or 3 half-lives of the antibody, whichever is shorter) prior to enrollment on protocol (minimum of 1 week between prior therapy and study enrollment) except for monoclonal antibody therapies that have been proven to be safe when combined with PARP inhibitor (PARPi) treatment (such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-HER2), which must be completed >= 4 weeks prior to enrollment \n\n Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents \n\n Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic disease has remained stable for >= 1 month without requiring steroid and anti-seizure medication are eligible to participate \n\n Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of talazoparib will be determined following review by the principal investigator \n\n Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements \n\n Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown \n\n Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial \n\n Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded.

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies if talazoparib works in patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and has mutation(s) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes who have or have not already been treated with another PARP inhibitor. Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, a protein that helps repair damaged DNA. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. All patients who take part on this study must have a gene aberration that changes how their tumors are able to repair DNA. This trial may help scientists learn whether some patients might benefit from taking different PARP inhibitors one after the other and learn how talazoparib works in treating patients with advanced cancer who have aberration in DNA repair genes.",
