Male patients with female partner(s) of non-childbearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal or surgically sterile for at least 6 months prior to Screening): \n\n No additional contraception method is required. \n\n Hematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below: \n\n Hemoglobin equal to or more than 9 g/dL (transfusion to achieve this is allowed); \n\n Neutrophils equal to or more than 1.5 X 10 degree/L; and \n\n Platelet count equal to or more than100 X 109 degree/L (transfusion to achieve this is allowed). \n\n Hepatic function: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN), patient with liver metastases less than or equal to 5 X ULN, and serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN; \n\n Renal function: Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 45 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault; \n\n Cardiac function criteria: Left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 50% as assessed by multi-gated acquisition or ultrasound/echocardiography; corrected QT interval less than or equal to 470 ms; \n\n Consent to appropriate protection from direct sunlight (e.g., utilizing sunscreen daily, protective clothing, UV protection sunglasses), and avoid artificial tanning during the study participation; \n\n Able to swallow oral medication; and \n\n Willing and able to comply with all protocol required visits and assessments. \n\n ",
