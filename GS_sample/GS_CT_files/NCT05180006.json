Patient should be able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol. \n\n Female or male patients aged 18 years or older \n\n Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1 \n\n Histologically confirmed female breast cancer with no evidence of metastatic spread \n\n Candidate to surgery upfront or patients with an indication to standard of care neoadjuvant systemic treatment, assuming that systemic treatment starts after the completion of the pre-operative immunotherapy treatment, biopsies are undertaken before the start of the systemic treatment and the decision to administer neoadjuvant systemic treatment is made before randomization \n\n At least 11 mm in tumor size as determined by breast ultrasound \n\n ER, PR and HER2 will be locally assessed and defined as per ASCO/CAP guidelines \n\n For the TNBC cohort, ER < 1%, PR < 1% and HER2 not overexpressed/amplified \n\n For the HER2-positive cohort, presence of a HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as per ASCO/CAP guidelines \n\n Adequate haematologic and organ function defined by the following: \n\n ANC \u2265 1,500 cells/\u00b5l \n\n Platelet count \u2265 100,000/\u00b5l \n\n Haemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL (90g/L) \n\n Serum albumin \u2265 2.5 g/dL \n\n Creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN \n\n Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN, AST or ALT < 3 x ULN, ALP < 2.5 x ULN (patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum bilirubin level \u2264 3 \u00d7 the institutional ULN may be enrolled) \n\n For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR or aPTT \u2264 1.5 x ULN. For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen \n\n Patients of child-bearing potential are eligible, provided they have a negative serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test within 2 weeks or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment, and agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab, 28 days after the last dose of ipatasertib and 7 months after the last dose of pertuzumab and/or trastuzumab. \n\n A woman is considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal (\u2265 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and bilateral salpingectomy. \n\n Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception supplemented by a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity during the study and for at least 5 months after discontinuation of atezolizumab treatment, 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab, 28 days after the last dose of ipatasertib and 7 months after the last dose of pertuzumab and/or trastuzumab. Female subjects should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period. \n\n A highly effective birth control method is a one, which can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception; progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal occlusion; vasectomized partner (on the understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study duration), and sexual abstinence during the entire period of risk associated with study treatment. To prevent the risk of interaction between the study drug and hormonal contraceptives, hormonal contraceptives should be supplemented with a barrier method (preferably male condom). Following methods are considered as unacceptable methods (non-exhaustive list): periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal (coitus interruptus). \n\n Sexually actives males patients must agree to use condom during the study and for at least 5 months after discontinuation of atezolizumab treatment, 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab, 28 days after the last dose of ipatasertib and 7 months after the last dose of pertuzumab and/or trastuzumab. Also, it is recommended their women of childbearing potential partner use a highly effective method of contraception for the same duration. \n\n Patients must be affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same. \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "The aim of this study is to determine, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on biopsies and surgically removed tumor if short-treatment immunotherapy with atezolizumab monotherapy or in combination with other biologic agents (ipatasertib / Bevacizumab / Trastuzumab / Pertuzumab) is associated with increased levels of activated GzmB+ CD8+ T cells from baseline to post treatment sample.~Moreover, from baseline to post treatment sample, evolution of others biomarkers will be studied : GzmB/CD8, CD8/FoxP3, CD8/CD68 in IHC, cell proliferation, PD-L1, MHC-I, change in gene expression (RNA-Seq). Tjis study aim also to assess the safety and tolerability of study treatments in this population and to determine the effect of short-term immunotherapy treatment in pCR at surgery.~Patients will undergo tumor biopsies at screening and 15 days after the beginning of treatment (if they start neoadjuvant chemotherapy) / at surgery, in order to evaluate in IHC evolution of activated GzmB+ CD8+ T cells and evaluate other markers~It targets 2 different cohorts: newly diagnosed, non-metastatic early-stage triple-negative (TNBC) or HER2+ breast cancer. TNBC cohort is composed of 4 open-label, randomized arms, HER2+ of 2 arms.~A maximum of 210 patients will be included in the trial (147 in TNBC cohort and 63 in HER2+ cohort).~Tumor evaluation will be performed by clinical examination and Breast echography at baseline and end of treatment visit.~The safety of the product will be assessed at each cycle, through complete clinical exams, biological tests and through the collection of ongoing toxicities or adverse events.",
