    "brief_summary": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been demonstrated to be an effective prognostic marker in breast cancer. Various studies have shown that early TNBC breast cancer patients with positive ctDNA have high risk of cancer recurrence and worse prognosis. This study aimed to identify TNBC patients with positive ctDNA and initiate boost therapy in these high risk patients.",
