    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n metastatic breast cancer \n\n past radiation therapy and chemotherapy \n\n hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors \n\n prior valvular heart disease \n\n cardiomyopathy \n\n chronic or acute congestive heart failure \n\n LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction<50%) \n\n abnormal complete blood count \n\n pregnancy \n\n breast-feeding",
    "brief_summary": "The randomized LITE study will compare liposomal doxorubin versus standard epirubicin in the treatment of female breast cancer. In order to detect as early as possible post-chemotherapy cardiotoxicity, tissue Doppler imaging parameters elicited at transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary end-points.",
