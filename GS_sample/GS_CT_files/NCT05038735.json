    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Participant is an adult \u2265 18 years old at the time of informed consent and has signed informed consent before any trial related activities and according to local guidelines. \n\n If female, then the participant must be in postmenopausal status. Postmenopausal status is defined either by: prior bilateral oophorectomy, age \u226560 or age <60 and amenorrheic for 12 or more months in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol in the postmenopausal range per local normal range. \n\n Participant has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER+ and/or PgR+ breast cancer by local laboratory. \n\n Participant has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), or Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH)) test is required by local laboratory testing. \n\n Participant has at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST v1.1 criteria as assessed locally and confirmed centrally by BIRC (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation). The central confirmation by BIRC must be received prior to randomization \n\n Participant has recurrence or progression of disease during or after combined AI (i.e. letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. The combined AI and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy does not need to be the latest treatment regimen (including adjuvant setting). \n\n Participant has received \u22641 line of prior treatment with chemotherapy (except for neoadjuvant/ adjuvant chemotherapy) and participant has received \u22642 prior lines of systemic therapies overall in the metastatic setting. \n\n Participant must show the presence of a PIK3CA mutation(s) determined in tumor tissue prior ro enrollment either by a Novartis designated laboratory or in tumor tissue or plasma ctDNA by a local laboratory using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PIK3CA Companion Diagnostics (CDx) test for alpelisib or the CE-IVD QIAGEN Therascreen\u00ae PIK3CA RGQ PCR test. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Participant with symptomatic visceral disease that makes the participant ineligible for endocrine therapy (ET) per the investigator's best judgment. \n\n Participant who relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months from completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine/endocrine-based therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease \n\n Participant has received prior treatment with fulvestrant, any oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERDs), any Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) or Protein Kinase B (AKT) inhibitor \n\n Other Inclusion and ",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to complement Study CBYL719C2301 (SOLAR-1) and obtain more comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of alpelisib (BYL719) in combination with fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in men or postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation who progressed or relapsed on or after treatment with an AI plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor.",
