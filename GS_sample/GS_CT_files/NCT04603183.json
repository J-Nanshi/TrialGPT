If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by Sponsor's qualified designee. \n\n Willingness to provide blood samples for exploratory studies at baseline, after two weeks of study treatment and at progression (or study treatment termination prior to start alternative anti cancer therapy). \n\n Patients relapsing on a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor based regimen in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting will be suitable for the study if disease progression is confirmed after at least 12 months following CDK 4/6 treatment completion. \n\n No prior systemic therapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. \n\n Radiation therapy for metastatic disease is permitted but the patient must have fully recovered from the acute effects and at least 14 days must have elapsed between the last dose and randomization. \n\n Note: For limited-field radiotherapy, at least 7 days must have elapsed between the last dose and randomization. \n\n Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti cancer therapy to Grade \u22641 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v 5.0 (except for Grade \u22642 neuropathy, alopecia, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion) within at least 14 days prior to study Day 1. \n\n Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days before the first study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1, defined by the following: \n\n Hematological: White blood cell count >3.0 \u00d7 109/L; Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5 \u00d7 109/L (without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1); Platelet count \u2265100 \u00d7 109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1); Hemoglobin >9.0 g/dL (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1). \n\n Hepatic: \n\n i. Serum albumin \u2265 3 g/dL; ii. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (\u22642 \u00d7 ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); iii. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase \u22643.0 \u00d7 ULN (in the case of liver metastases \u22645 \u00d7 ULN); iv. Alkaline phosphatase \u22642.5 \u00d7 ULN (in the case of liver and/or bone metastases \u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN). \n\n c. Renal: i. Serum creatinine <1.5 \u00d7 ULN or creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min based on Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation. \n\n d. Coagulation: i. Partial thromboplastin time (or activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio \u22641.5\u00d7ULN. \n\n For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use highly effective contraceptive methods, or two effective contraceptive methods, as defined in the protocol during the treatment period and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs during this same period. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days before study treatment initiation. \n\n Male patients should also have their partners who are women of childbearing potential use highly effective contraceptive methods, or two effective contraceptive methods, as defined in the protocol during the treatment period and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period. \n\n Able to swallow oral medication. \n\n Patients who are reliable, willing to be available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Known hypersensitivity to abemaciclib, letrozole, fulvestrant, paclitaxel, and/or any of their excipients. \n\n Are currently receiving an investigational drug in a clinical study or participating in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. \n\n Note: For patients who stopped receiving an investigational drug in another clinical study, a washout period of 21 days or 5-half-lives (whichever is shorter) must be observed before entering the trial. \n\n Formal contraindication to ET defined as visceral crisis and rapidly or symptomatic progressive visceral disease. \n\n Known concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 5 years of study enrollment except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non melanoma skin carcinoma, or stage I uterine cancer. For other cancers considered to have a low risk of recurrence, discussion with the medical monitor is required. \n\n Known active brain metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable for \u22654 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for \u226514 days prior to first dose of study treatment. \n\n Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study. \n\n Major surgical procedure within 14 days prior to treatment initiation or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis. \n\n Note: Placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted. \n\n Active bleeding diathesis, previous history of bleeding diathesis, or chronic anti-coagulation treatment (the use of low molecular weight heparin is allowed if used prophylactically). \n\n Serious and/or uncontrolled pre existing medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g., estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or pre-existing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a pre existing chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea). \n\n Current known infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAg] test and a positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA test) are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA. \n\n Active bacterial or fungal infection at the time of enrolment (requiring antibiotics or antifungal agents at time of initiating study treatment). \n\n History of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. \n\n Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through at least 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.",
    "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, randomized, 2 arm, open label, phase II study. It is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus a short course with induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel followed by maintenance therapy with abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant) in patients with previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic HR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer with aggressive disease criteria.",
