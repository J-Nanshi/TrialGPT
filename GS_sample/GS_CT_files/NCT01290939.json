However, patients with clinically asymptomatic presence of hemosiderin depositions, resolving hemorrhagic changes related to surgery, and presence of punctate hemorrhage in the tumor are permitted entry into the study \n\n No history or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding. \n\n No arterial or venous thrombosis \u2264 6 months prior to randomization \n\n No history of stroke or TIAs within 6 months prior to randomization \n\n No history of pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis \u2265 grade 2 according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 criteria within 1 month prior to randomization \n\n Absence of current or recent (within 10 days of first dose of bevacizumab) use of aspirin (> 325 mg/day) or other NSAID with anti-platelet activity or treatment with dipyramidole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel or cilostaz. \n\n International normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 ULN and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) > 1.5 \u00d7 the ULN. Use of full-dose anticoagulants is permitted as long as the INR or aPTT is within therapeutic limits (according to the medical standard in the institution) and the patient has been on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least two weeks before randomization. As per ASCO guidelines, LMWH should be the preferred approach. \n\n Absence of known hypersensitivity: \n\n to any part of the bevacizumab or lomustine formulations. \n\n to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanized antibody. \n\n No underlying or previous conditions that could interfere with treatment, including but not limited to: \n\n No history of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to randomization \n\n No clinically serious (as judged by the investigator) non-healing wounds, active skin ulcers or incompletely healed bone fracture. \n\n No history of active gastroduodenal ulcer(s). \n\n No history of abdominal fistula as well as non-GI fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to inclusion. \n\n No evidence of active infection requiring hospitalization or antibiotics, within 2 weeks prior to randomization. \n\n No other diseases, interfering with follow up. \n\n Normal hematological functions: neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x 109 cells/l, platelets \u2265 100 x 109 cells/l and Hb \u2265 6.2 mmol/l (9.9 g/dl). \n\n Normal liver function: bilirubin < 1.5 x upper limit of the normal range (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and transaminases (ASAT) < 2.5 x ULN. \n\n Normal renal function: calculated (Cockcroft-Gault) or measured creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min; Urine dipstick for proteinuria < 2+. Patients with \u2265 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo 24 hours urine collection and must demonstrate \u2264 1 g of protein/24 hr. \n\n Age \u2265 18 years \n\n WHO Performance status 0 - 2 \n\n Absence of pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and 6 months beyond stop of treatment in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. In general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy should be determined by discussions between the investigator and the study subject. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Females should not be breast feeding. \n\n Post menopause is defined as: amenorrhea \u2265 12 consecutive months without another cause or for women with irregular menstrual periods and on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35 mIU/mL \n\n Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicide) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. \n\n Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of investigational product. \n\n Female patients within one year of entering the menopause must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last study treatment. \n\n Males must agree to use an effective method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last study treatment. \n\n Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; such conditions should be assessed with the patient before randomization in the trial. \n\n Before patient randomization and study related procedures (that would not have been performed as part as standard care), written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Informed consent should also be given for biological material to be stored and used for future research on brain tumors. \n\n Patients with a buffer range from the normal values of +/- 5 % for hematology and +/- 10% for biochemistry are acceptable. A maximum of +/- 2 days for timelines may be acceptable (one day for post operative MRI).",

    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lomustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known which regimen of bevacizumab given together with lomustine is most effective in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first recurrence.~PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to lomustine improves overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma compared to treatment with lomustine alone.",
