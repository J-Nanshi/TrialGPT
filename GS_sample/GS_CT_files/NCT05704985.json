    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Subjects with documented diffuse peritoneal disease or persistent abundant ascites \n\n Subjects with known prolonged QtC interval \n\n Concomitant or recent (<4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the last treatment, whichever is shorter) treatment with agents with anti-tumor activity, including immunotherapies, or experimental therapies. Bone treatments and supportive care can be continued \n\n Major surgery within 4 weeks, Radiation therapy for the treatment of metastases within less than 3 weeks (if single fraction of radiotherapy, then within 2 weeks) and radionuclide therapy for the treatment of metastases within 4 weeks prior to screening \n\n Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing and uncontrolled infection (TBC, COVID or HIV patients treated with at least two anti-retroviral drugs and control of their infection with at least 500 /mm3 CD4+ T-cells in their blood and patients cured from Hepatitis B or C (i.e negativity of PCR) and liver function compatible with eligibility criteria are allowed to participate), multiple myeloma, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirement \n\n Any other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the subject to be unsuitable for the study \n\n Additional criteria may apply",
