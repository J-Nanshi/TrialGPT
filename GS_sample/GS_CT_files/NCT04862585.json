    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients who have received at least 1 prior lifetime dose of paclitaxel or paclitaxel albumin-bound \n\n Patients receiving paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin or cisplatin (due to risk of hypersensitivity with platinum compounds) \n\n History of grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction to Cremophor EL containing medications (e.g. paclitaxel, cyclosporine, ixabepilone, teniposide) \n\n Patients receiving therapeutic daily doses of systemic corticosteroids. Intermittent oral steroids for nausea or for acute inflammatory conditions (i.e. methylprednisolone dosepak) and inhaled, intranasal or topical corticosteroids are permitted \n\n Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Paclitaxel is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as pregnancy category D. Pregnancy testing (urine or blood human chorionic gonadotropin [Hcg]) will be done and documented prior to enrollment if pregnancy is clinically suspected",
    "brief_summary": "This phase II/III trial investigates the difference in rates of infusion hypersensitivity reaction in patients with breast cancer who are receiving paclitaxel alone or in combination with other cancer drugs which require parenteral rescue medication after stopping standard pre-medications (dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine/cimetidine/ranitidine), compared to continuing premedications. Paclitaxel is a drug used to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi sarcoma. It blocks cell growth by stopping cell division and may kill cancer cells. It is a type of antimitotic agent. However, there are side-effects and toxicities associated with repeat exposure to this pre-medication regimen. With prolonged use of paclitaxel, especially during weekly regimens, patients are exposed to repeat doses of drugs that prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Side effects include, but are not limited to, insomnia, gastritis, fluid retention, weight gain, mood changes and immune suppression. The information gained from this study may positively influence clinical practice and help researchers develop methods to safely stop pre-medications.",
