    "brief_summary": "At present, trastuzumab combined with patuzumab has become the standard neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk HER2 positive breast cancer. TCbHP has been the standard choice of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2 positive breast cancer patients with early high-risk or locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. Whether nab-PHP can achieve the same effect as TCbHP is still uncertain.",
