    "brief_summary": "This is an Italian, single center, randomized, phase II study. ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and derivatives (retinoids) are promising anticancer agents and exert their anti-proliferative, differentiating and apoptotic effects through the nuclear retinoic acid receptors, including RAR\u03b1 (retinoic acid receptor alpha). Although the clinical use of ATRA in haematological malignancies (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, APL) is well established, its use in solid tumors is limited. However, some recent pre-clinical evidence suggests a possible role of ATRA in the treatment of specific subtypes of HR-positive (Hormonal Receptor)/HER2-negative early breast cancer (eBC).~Moving from pre-clinical evidence and given the well-known retinoid mechanism of action, The hypotheses is that ATRA contributes to tumor regression in a specific sub-population of eBCs. Using a preoperative window-of-opportunity model, aimed at testing the activity of ATRA in combination with anastrozole in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, resectable, HR+/HER2- eBCs.",
