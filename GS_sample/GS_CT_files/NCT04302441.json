    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients with bilateral breast cancer or carcinoma in situ(DCIS/LCIS). \n\n Metastasis of any part except axillary lymph nodes. \n\n Clinical or imaging suspicion of the contralateral breast is malignant but not confirmed, requiring biopsy. \n\n There have been malignant tumors (except for basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ of cervix) in the last five years, including breast cancer. \n\n Patients have been enrolled in other clinical trials. \n\n Patients with severe systemic illnesses and/or uncontrolled infections are unable to join the study. \n\n Patients with severe cardio-cerebrovascular disorders (e.g., unstable angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, uncontrollable hypertension >160/100mmgh, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) in the first 6 months of randomization. \n\n Pregnant lactating women (child-bearing women must be negative for pregnancy test within 14 days prior to first delivery, if positive, the pregnancy should be excluded by ultrasound.) \n\n Child-bearing women who are unwilling to take effective contraceptive measures in the course of research. \n\n Patients with mental illness, cognitive impairment, inability to understand test protocols and side effects, and those who fail to complete the trial programme and follow-up work (a systematic assessment is required before the trial). \n\n Persons without personal freedom and independent civil capacity.",
