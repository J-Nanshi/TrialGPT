    "brief_summary": "Women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who are hormone receptor positive are candidates for first line hormonal therapy including aromatase inhibitors. In the past few years new combination therapies became available as fulvastrant or palbociclib with letrezole; increasing the progression free survival (PFS). A retrospective study showed that combination of capecitabine with aromatase inhibitors increase PFS as 1st and 2nd line line treatment another prospective study showed the same results. The aim of our study is confirm such data by a randomized controlled trial.",
