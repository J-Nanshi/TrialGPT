This tumor tissue must meet the following criteria: \n\n Tissue must have been collected within 12 months prior to registration to the EAY191 Registration Trial \n\n Patient must not have had a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to any intervening therapy after collection of the tissue \n\n Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) or slides must be available OR \n\n Patients under 18 years old must confirm availability of an archival tumor tissue specimen for submission for research if patient enrolls to a ComboMATCH Treatment Trial. This tumor tissue must meet the following criteria: \n\n Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) or slides must be available \n\n NOTE: See specific ComboMATCH Treatment Trial protocol for tissue collection and management instructions. Performance of the mandatory research biopsy or submission of pre-trial formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and collection and submission of the blood specimens for the integrated studies will be performed under the consent authority of the specific treatment trial protocol to which the patient is registered. No procedures to collect specimens for research only are to be performed for patients registered to the EAY191 Registration Trial only \n\n NOTE: Each ComboMATCH Treatment Trial contains specific eligibility criteria. If patient is found to not be eligible for the assigned ComboMATCH Treatment Trial, indication of ineligibility will trigger re-evaluation and potential assignment to another Treatment Trial",

    "brief_summary": "This ComboMATCH patient registration trial is the gateway to a coordinated set of clinical trials to study cancer treatment directed by genetic testing. Patients with solid tumors that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and have progressed on at least one line of standard systemic therapy or have no standard treatment that has been shown to prolong overall survival may be candidates for these trials. Genetic tests look at the unique genetic material (genes) of patients' tumor cells. Patients with some genetic changes or abnormalities (mutations) may benefit from treatment that targets that particular genetic mutation. ComboMATCH is designed to match patients to a treatment that may work to control their tumor and may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with locally advanced or advanced solid tumors.",
