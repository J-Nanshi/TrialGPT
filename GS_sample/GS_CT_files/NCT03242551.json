    "brief_summary": "The BINC-B trial is a diagnostic and interventional study in which various function imaging methods as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PWI, DWI and DCE-MRI) and will be compared with common imaging methods (mammography and/or ultrasound) to investigate if an early response to a combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable or potentially operable breast cancer. For breast cancer patients with positive HER-2, additional Herceptin could improve the response further. In this study the efficacy of combined neoadjuvant therapy with or without Herceptin should be evaluated and the role in predicting the tumor response with different imaging should be estimated.",
