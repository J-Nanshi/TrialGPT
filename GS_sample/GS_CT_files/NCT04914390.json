    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, single-arm and open-label phase II study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with tislelizumab and AT regimen as neoadjuvant treatment for triple-negative breast cancer. Participants will undergo/receive PDL1 testing after enrollment. All patients will be receive 6 cycles of low-dose anlotinib combined with tislelizumab and AT\uff08Doxorubicin or Epirubicin+albumin-bound paclitaxel\uff09regimen, followed by surgery.",
