    "brief_summary": "This study is being done to see if tucatinib works better than placebo to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery. All patients in the study will get capecitabine and trastuzumab, two drugs that are often used to treat this cancer.~There are two parts to this study. The first part of the study is already complete. Patients were randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill with no medicine). Since this part was blinded, neither patients nor their doctors knew whether a patient got tucatinib or placebo.~The second part of the study is called the Unblinded Phase. In this part of the study, participants and their doctors know which drugs are being given. Participants who used to get or are currently getting placebo may be able to start taking tucatinib instead.~Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills two times every day. They will swallow capecitabine pills two times a day during the first two weeks of each cycle. Patients will get trastuzumab injections from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.",
