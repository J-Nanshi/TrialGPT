Oral, injectable, or implant hormonal contraceptives are not allowed) \n\n Signed informed consent form (ICF) \n\n Patient accepts to make available tumour samples for submission to central laboratory to conduct translational studies as part of this protocol \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Received any prior treatment for primary invasive breast cancer; \n\n Previous (less than 10 years) or current history of malignant neoplasms, except for curatively treated: \n\n Basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; \n\n Carcinoma in situ of the cervix. \n\n Patients with a prior malignancy diagnosed more than 10 years prior to randomisation may enter the study. Patients must have been curatively treated with surgery alone. Radiation therapy or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine) are NOT permitted. Prior diagnoses of breast cancer or melanoma are excluded. \n\n Diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer; \n\n Bilateral cancer; \n\n This criterion has been deleted from the protocol Version 1. Patients with multi-focal cancer are no longer excluded. \n\n Known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, clinically significant arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, transmural myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension (\u2265180/110), unstable diabetes mellitus, dyspnoea at rest, or chronic therapy with oxygen; \n\n Concurrent disease or condition that would make the subject inappropriate for study participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety; \n\n Unresolved or unstable, serious adverse events from prior administration of another investigational drug; \n\n Active or uncontrolled infection; \n\n Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prevent the understanding or rendering of ICF; \n\n Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel. Subjects with ulcerative colitis are also excluded; \n\n Concurrent neoadjuvant cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy other than the trial therapies); \n\n Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial; \n\n Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to trastuzumab or lapatinib or their excipients; \n\n Pregnant or lactating women; \n\n Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers",
    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, open-label, real-word study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive and p95HER2-positive ,or PI3K mutation, or PTEN loss breast cancer . Eligible subjects will have newly diagnosed breast cancer (Stage II-III) ; not have received systemic or local treatment . The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). The secondary objectives are to evaluate overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit response rate and the safety as well as tolerability of lapatinib plus chemotherapy and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.~Patients will receive lapatinib 1000 mg daily or trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenous (IV) load followed by 2 mg/kg IV weekly for a total of 12 weeks. After surgery, patients planned total duration of the anti-HER2 therapy will be one year.",
