    "brief_summary": "The management of HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer includes endocrine monotherapy or combination regimens, both with benefit diminishing as resistance develops. Nowadays, various studies have demonstrated that estrogen interacts with many angiogenic pathways and is an important mechanism for resistance leading to the question of whether combination with antiangiogenesis and antiestrogen therapies could be an appropriate therapeutic modality. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that effectively inhibit VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, c-KIT, c-MET and RET. Previous studies have proven the efficacy of both anlotinib monotherapy and combination regimens in advanced breast cancer. This phase II study aims to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with endocrine therapy.",
