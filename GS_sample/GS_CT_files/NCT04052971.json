The number of patients with only c-MET overexpression is limited to 50% of enrolled patients in that dosing cohort including escalation and extension. \n\n For Phase 2, must have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC with suspected MET exon 14 skipping by local biomarker assessment and confirmed MET exon 14 skipping by central biomarker assessment as defined in study protocol. \n\n Progressive disease: \n\n Phase 1: Progressive disease on established standard medical anti-cancer therapy for his/her tumor type or intolerant to such therapy, or in the opinion of the investigator considered ineligible for a particular form of standard therapy on medical grounds. \n\n Phase 2: Progressive disease after standard of care treatments with no greater than 2 prior treatment regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and maintenance therapies do not qualify as separate treatment regimens). \n\n At least one measurable lesion per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, with the exception of bone-only disease (i.e., non-measurable disease per RECIST 1.1) with at least 1 radiological non-target lesion. \n\n If not menopausal or surgically sterile, willing to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control for at least a (partner's) menstrual cycle before and for 3 months after study drug administration: \n\n True abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, from sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex, \n\n Sexual intercourse with vasectomized male/sterilized female partner, \n\n Hormonal female contraceptive (oral, parenteral, intravaginal, implantable or transdermal) for at least 3 consecutive months prior to investigational product administration (when not clinically contraindicated as in breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers), \n\n Use of an intrauterine contraceptive device. \n\n Resolution of prior-therapy-related AEs (including immune-related AEs but excluding alopecia) to \u2264 Grade 1 per CTCAE, and no treatment for these AEs for at least 2 weeks prior to the time of enrollment. Alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade \u2264 2, or other Grade \u2264 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable. \n\n Phase 1 only: minimum of 2 weeks since last dose of hormone therapy. \n\n Minimum of > 2 weeks or > 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) between the start of study treatment since last dose of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or molecularly targeted agents or tyrosine kinase inhibitors; minimum of > 3 weeks of the start of study treatment since last dose of immunotherapy/monoclonal antibodies; > 6 weeks of the start of study treatment since the last dose of nitrosoureas, antibody-drug conjugates or radioactive isotopes. \n\n Adequate organ function as indicated by the laboratory values. \n\n Tissue and/or blood specimens: \n\n Phase 1: Available archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen. \n\n The archival tissue must be: \n\n collected after progression from most recent prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, OR \n\n the samples of previous lines of treatment. If patient wants to participate to the study but does not want to give the blood and tissue samples for the exploratory study, patient might be able to participate after discussion and approval of sponsor and the medical monitor. \n\n Phase 2: Biomarker Criteria: Willing to undergo a new biopsy or have available archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen. The archival tissue must be: \n\n collected after progression from most recent prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, OR \n\n tissue samples collected prior to previous lines of treatment, OR, if biopsy is not possible and archival tissue is unavailable: \n\n Must undergo blood sample for biomarker assessment \n\n If the patient agrees to optional pre- and/or study new tumor biopsies (that can be biopsied based on investigator's assessment) and to provide the tissue for biomarker analysis, a signed informed consent for the biopsy is required. Tissue obtained for the biopsy must not be previously irradiated. No systemic antineoplastic therapy may be received by the patient between the time of the biopsy and the first administration of ABN401. \n\n For escalation, each dose escalation cohort must try to enroll at least 1 patient who agrees to biopsies. An exception to the requirement for a new tumor biopsy in at least one patient per dose level is that if the first patient in a single dose cohort does not consent to a new tumor biopsy and the cohort is not expanded to 3 or 6 patients, a biopsy will not be required in that cohort. Note: During pre-treatment FFPE tissue samples (unstained slides or blocks) or new frozen tissue may be provided for tumor analyses. \n\n Able and willing to comply with the protocol and the restrictions and assessments therein. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to any component of ABN401. \n\n Prior therapy: \n\n Phase 1: Treatment with more than 4 lines of prior systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease. If the patient was treated with more than 4 lines but his/her condition is eligible to participate to the trial by the investigator's judgement, the patient might be able to be enrolled to the trial under the medical monitor and the sponsor's approval, \n\n Phase 2: Previous treatment with c-MET inhibitors or HGF-targeting therapy. \n\n Genetic analysis: \n\n Phase 1 Extension Cohort, existing data by genetic analysis of the patient's tumor tissue that may result in an increased probability of being resistant to c-MET inhibitors, including 1) EGFRi; 2) ALKi; 3) ROSi; 4) BRAFi; 5) NTRKi; 6) RETi, \n\n Phase 2 Expansion Cohorts: existing genetic data from the patient's tumor tissue showing known molecular alterations which would make them eligible for targeted therapies (such as EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, KRAS mutation, ROS1 translocation, BRAF mutation, RET alteration, and NTRK fusion, etc.). \n\n Chronic inflammatory liver condition. History or clinical evidence of any liver or biliary pathology including cirrhosis, infectious disease, inflammatory conditions, steatosis, or cholangitis (including ascending cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, obstruction, perforation, fistula of biliary tract, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, biliary cyst or biliary atresia). \n\n Prior organ or stem cell transplant. \n\n Known active infection with HIV, HTLV-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV): \n\n Patients with a history of hepatitis B or C are allowed if HBV DNA or HCV RNA are undetectable, \n\n Active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and CD4+ T-cell count <350/\u03bcL.
