    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that can be removed by surgery (resectable) and does not respond to treatment with chemotherapy alone, or in combination with pembrolizumab. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
