    "brief_summary": "TC-510 is a novel cell therapy that consists of autologous genetically engineered T cells expressing two synthetic constructs: first, a single-domain antibody that recognizes human Mesothelin, fused to the CD3-epsilon subunit which, upon expression, is incorporated into the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) complex and second, a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the T cell, independently from the TCR. The PD-1:CD28 switch receptor comprises the PD-1 extracellular domain fused to the CD28 intracellular domain via a transmembrane domain. Thus, the switch is designed to produce a costimulatory signal upon engagement with PD-L1 on cancer cells.",
