    "brief_summary": "This randomized Phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in combination with carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel compared with treatment with carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive participants with Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A (Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin) or Arm B (Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin).",
