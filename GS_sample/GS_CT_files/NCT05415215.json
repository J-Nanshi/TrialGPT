J Clin Oncol 2020) \n\n Agreement to undergo mastectomy or breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, including the axillary nodes \n\n Availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block for local confirmation of HER2 and hormone receptor status following current ASCO/CAP guidelines \n\n inclusion criteria for Treatment with Adjuvant PH FDC SC: \n\n Completed the neoadjuvant phase of this study and underwent surgery, and achieved pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as eradication of invasive disease in the breast and axilla according to the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system classification, and using the resected specimen by the local pathologist on the basis of guidelines to be provided in a pathology manual \n\n Adequate wound healing after breast cancer surgery per investigator's assessment to allow initiation of study treatment within less than or equal to (\u2264)9 weeks of last systemic neoadjuvant therapy \n\n ",
