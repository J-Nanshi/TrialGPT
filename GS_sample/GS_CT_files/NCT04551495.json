Biopsies at screening must have been obtained up to max 6 weeks before the beginning of treatment. \n\n Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including treatment and scheduled visits and examinations. \n\n Women who are not postmenopausal or have not undergone hysterectomy must have documented negative pregnancy test (serum) within 28 days prior to enrolment. \n\n Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must agree to use one highly effective form of contraception (see protocol section 6.6.1) from the signing of the ICF until at least 5 weeks after last administration of entrectinib, or they must totally/truly abstain from any form of sexual intercourse. Use of oral hormonal contraceptive agents in this study is not permitted. \n\n Inclusion criterion applicable to FRANCE only: \n\n Subject is affiliated to the French Social Security System. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Clinical T4 disease including inflammatory breast cancer and/or cN3. \n\n Prior history of invasive cancer in the past 5 years except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of skin that has been definitively treated. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or excipients. \n\n Hyperuricemia > Grade 1 \n\n Any illness or medical condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the subject or her compliance with study requirements. \n\n Subjects unable to swallow oral medications. \n\n Prior intake of letrozole, any ROS1 inhibitor, any TRK inhibitor or anticancer therapy (including endocrine therapy). Ovarian suppression including prior administration of a LHRH analogue (i.e. goserelin) is allowed prior to cycle 1 day 1, at the discretion of the investigator. \n\n Concurrent treatment with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor. \n\n Concurrent treatment with any of the drugs not permitted, i.e. strong CYP3A inducers and drugs known to cause QTc interval prolongation. \n\n Significant cardiac disease, including recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and bradyarrhythmias. \n\n LVEF \u2264 55% measured by echo or MUGA \n\n QTc exceeding 450 msec, history of prolonged QTc interval prolongation; risk factors for torsade de pointes; other concomitant medications that may prolong QTc; family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation, or Torsade de Pointes (TdP). \n\n Pregnant or lactating women. \n\n Known interstitial lung disease, interstitial fibrosis, or history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced pneumonitis \n\n Peripheral neuropathy \u2265 Grade 2 \n\n Active gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would reasonably impact drug absorption. \n\n Exclusion criterion applicable to France only \n\n Vulnerable persons according to the article L.1121-6 of the CSP, adults who are the subject of a measure of legal protection or unable to express their consent according to article L.1121-8 of the CSP.",
    "brief_summary": "Despite different clinical characteristics including the response to treatment and the patterns of metastatic relapse, invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILBC) is treated like invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDBC) carcinoma both in the clinics and in clinical trials. A large majority of ILBC are ER+/HER2- and almost 90% have loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression. A non-clinical study of CDH1 synthetic lethality interactions has identified ROS1 as a potential target. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound antitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer, providing the preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors in this setting. Endocrine therapy being the mainstay of therapy for ER+/HER2- ILBC and the pre-operative setting offering a platform for rapid drug evaluation and biomarker research, the ROSALINE phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of Entrectinib (a potent inhibitor of ROS1 among other targets) in combination with letrozole (+ goserelin in premenopausal women) in the early setting of ILBC (stages 1 to 3). The neoadjuvant therapy will last 4 months and post-operative therapy will follow local practice. Biomarker research will include RNA sequencing of initial biopsies and surgical specimens, as well as liquid biopsies.",
