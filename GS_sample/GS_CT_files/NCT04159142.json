    "brief_summary": "This is a multi-center , open-lable clinical trial. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a term applied to breast cancer cases that have <1% expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) and do not over express HER2. TNBC is diagnosed in 15-20% of breast cancer cases and tends to occur in younger women and have biologically more aggressive high grade disease.~The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the following two combinations: i) nab-paclitaxel+carboplatin; ii) nab-paclitaxel+capecitabine in subjects with advanced TNBC and up to one prior line of systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Maintenance therapy with capecitabine after completion of combination chemotherapy.",
