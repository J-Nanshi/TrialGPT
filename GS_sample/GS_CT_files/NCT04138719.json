    "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, open, randomized, comparison study. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a term applied to breast cancer cases that have <1% expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) and do not over express HER2.~Neoadjuvant therapy is often used to reduce the size of tumors, especially in locally advanced tumors. The purpose of this therapy is to make part of patients operable and to facilitate breast-conserving surgery.~The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the following two proposals: nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus nab-paclitaxel plus epirubicin, in order to provide support for rational clinical application.~The total number of patients to be included in this study is 520 patients.",
