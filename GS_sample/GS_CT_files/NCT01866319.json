    "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 different dosing schedules of pembrolizumab (MK-3475), every 2 weeks (Q2W) and every 3 weeks (Q3W), and compare the 2 schedules to treatment with ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab is superior to ipilimumab with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).",
