    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-1] antibody) plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (camrelizumab +chemotherapy) or Arm B (placebo + chemotherapy).",
