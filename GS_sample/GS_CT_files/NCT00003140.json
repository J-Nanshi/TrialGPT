    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.~PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying letrozole to see how well it works in treating women with breast cancer who have received tamoxifen for at least 5 years.",
