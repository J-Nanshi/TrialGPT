    "brief_summary": "This is a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with apatinib (a VEGFR2 TKI) for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and >10% tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in baseline breast tumors. We will enroll 58 subjects (Simon's two stage design). The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC with a high proportion of TILs.",
