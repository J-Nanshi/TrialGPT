Baseline staging to document absence of metastatic disease is not required, however is recommended as determined by institutional practice (in patients where there may be a reasonable suspicion of advanced disease e.g., large tumors, clinically positive axillary lymph nodes, signs and symptoms). If performed, reports of these examinations must be available. Examination type for staging, i.e. X-ray, sonography, bone scan, CT, MRI, and/or PET-CT, is at the discretion of the investigator. \n\n Bilateral invasive breast cancer. \n\n Patients who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to study treatment. \n\n Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills. \n\n Malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteric absorption of study drugs. \n\n Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrolment or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer. \n\n Patient with a Child-Pugh score B or C. \n\n Patient has active cardiac disease or a history of cardiac dysfunction including any of the following: \n\n History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty or stenting) or symptomatic pericarditis within 12 months prior to screening. \n\n History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification III-IV). \n\n Documented cardiomyopathy. \n\n Patient has a Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO). \n\n Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g. bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third-degree AV block). \n\n Long QT Syndrome or family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome or any of the following: \n\n Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia. \n\n QTc >500 msec or conduction abnormality in the previous 12 months. \n\n On screening 12-lead ECG, any of the following cardiac parameters: bradycardia (resting heart rate <50), tachycardia (resting heart rate >90), PR interval >220 msec, QRS interval >109 msec, or QTcF interval \u2265450 msec (using Fridericia's correction). \n\n Uncontrolled hypertension (Systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg or <90 mmHg and/or diastolic >100 mmHg). \n\n Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics. \n\n Prior story of pneumonitis of any cause. \n\n Prior thromboembolic events not attributable to a clear trigger cause. \n\n Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n\n Any other diseases, active or uncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, that may compromise compliance with the protocol, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or renders the patients at high risk from treatment complications. \n\n Significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. \n\n Major surgical procedure (not including minor procedures such as lymph node biopsy, tumor core biopsy, fine needle aspiration or bilateral oophorectomy) within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment or not fully recovered from any side effects of previous procedures. \n\n Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule. \n\n Patients with a history of any malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: \n\n Patients with a malignancy history other than invasive breast cancer are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. \n\n Patients with the following cancers are eligible, even if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervical cancer in situ, and non-metastatic non-melanomatous skin cancers. \n\n Estrogen replacement therapy stopped less than 2 weeks before treatment start. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib, letrozole, goserelin or decapapetyl (if men or pre-menopausal). \n\n Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of study. \n\n Patients currently on following medications, which cannot be interrupted 7 days prior treatment start: \n\n Any prohibited medication as per goserelin or decapapetyl (pre-menopasual patients), letrozole or ribociclib label \n\n Herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements. \n\n Medications that have a known risk to prolong the QT interval or cause Torsades de Pointe. \n\n Medications with a narrow therapeutic window and predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4. \n\n Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, including grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pummelos, star-fruit and Seville oranges. \n\n Strong inducers of CYP3A4. \n\n Warfarin or other coumarin-derived anticoagulant for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux is allowed. \n\n A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to allocation (see Appendix 1). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. \n\n Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication. \n\n Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. \n\n Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. \n\n Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

    "brief_summary": "This is an open-label, multicenter international trial in men and women with primary operable HR+/HER2-, ki67\u226520%, grade 2 or 3 and stage II breast cancer to evaluate safety and long-term efficacy of a non-chemo treatment in patients biologically responders to neoadjuvant ribociclib and letrozole.~This study aims to evaluate whether chemotherapy could be avoided for initial high-risk clinicopathological breast cancer patients that are converted to low genomic risk assessed by Risk of Recurrence-low (ROR-low) at 6 months of letrozole - ribociclib neoadjuvant treatment by continuing with this treatment in adjuvant setting.",
