    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells. If is not yet known which treatment regimen is most effective for breast cancer.~PURPOSE: Randomized double-blind phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of letrozole with that of tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal women who have breast cancer that has been surgically removed.",
