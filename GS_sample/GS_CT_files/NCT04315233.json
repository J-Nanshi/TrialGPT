    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous use of CDK 4/6 or HDAC inhibitors for cancer treatment \n\n Major surgery, radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agents \u2264 4 weeks of treatment day 1 or \u22645 half-lives, whichever is shorter. \n\n Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease unless determined by the treating physician that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy. \n\n Medical condition that in the opinion of the enrolling investigator would require the use of valproic acid within \u2264 5 days of the first dose of belinostat or while on study. \n\n Active infection requiring systemic therapy. \n\n History of allergy or hypersensitivity to belinostat, ribociclib, or their binders. \n\n Uncontrolled arrhythmia, congestive heart failure or angina.

Patients currently taking these medications must have discontinued \u22657 days prior to treatment day 1. \n\n Concurrent use of herbal supplements, unless approved by the prinicipal investigator. Patients currently taking herbal supplements must have discontinued \u2265 7 days prior to treatment day 1. \n\n Concurrent use of medication with a known risk of inducing Torsades de Pointes (on the known risk list of crediblemeds.org) that cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication \u2265 7 days prior to starting the study drug. \n\n Unresolved diarrhea \u2265 Grade 2, per CTCAE v5.0. \n\n Use of any of the following substances \u2264 7 days prior to the start of the treatment: \n\n Known strong and moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, including grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pomelos, star-fruit, and Seville oranges. \n\n Medications that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5. Examples include certain benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine. Ultimately determination of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window is left to the discretion of the principal investigator. \n\n Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin derived anti-coagulant, for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. \n\n --Note: Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), an oral factor Xa inhibitor, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, or fondaparinux is allowed. \n\n Impaired GI function that may alter absorption of medicines, such as uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease, uncontrolled vomiting, or major stomach or small bowel resection. \n\n Pregnant or breast feeding \n\n Women of child-bearing potential defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant or men whose female partner is of child-bearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 6 months after stopping the treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: \n\n Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception \n\n Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment \n\n Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient and the success of the vasectomy must be medically confirmed as per local practice. \n\n Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD). \n\n Use of hormonal contraception plus a barrier contraceptive. \n\n Known HIV infection with a detectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment. \n\n Note: Patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load within 6 months of the anticipated start of treatment are eligible for this trial. \n\n Known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus infection with a detectable viral load. \n\n --Note: Patients with an undetectable HBV viral load on appropriate suppressive therapy are eligible. Patients with an undetectable HCV viral load are eligible. \n\n Malignancy other than breast carcinoma or ovarian cancer (dose escalation) anticipated to need systemic treatment within 1 year in the opinion of the enrolling investigator.",
    "brief_summary": "This is an open-label, multi-center, phase I study designed to assess the maximum tolerated dose of ribociclib and belinostat in combination. The trial will open with a dose escalation followed by an expansion cohort at the identified dose. Dose escalation will be open to the enrollment of patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Dose expansion will only be open to patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer.",
