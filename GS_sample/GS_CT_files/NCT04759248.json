    "brief_summary": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors given in monotherapy in advanced breast cancer have shown modest benefit in first-line, but very limited efficacy in later lines. Thus, combination therapies are needed.~Response following anti-PD1/PD-L1 monotherapy is associated with large survival benefit in the advanced setting.~Previous studies of the intrinsic subtypes have shown that Basal-like and HER2-E are associated with higher expression of immune-related genes or higher infiltration of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared to the luminal subtypes. Immune infiltration in BC is associated with chemo/antiHER2 responsiveness and potentially benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.~In addition, one emerging biomarker of response to anti-PD-1 therapy is the tumor mutational burden (I.e. the total number of mutations per coding area of a tumor genome). The HER2-E and Basal-like profiles have been associated with high mutational burden.~A range of studies have been initiated including several phase II/III studies evaluating atezolizumab in combination with different chemotherapeutic compounds routinely used in breast cancer, but none with predefined biomarker beyond the expression of PD-L1 by IHC",
