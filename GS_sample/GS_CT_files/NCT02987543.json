    "exclusion_criteria": " \n\n Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib. \n\n Subjects who have any previous treatment with DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy, except if for non-prostate cancer indication and last dose > 5 years prior to randomization. \n\n Other malignancy (including MDS and MGUS) within the last 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \u22655 years. \n\n Subjects with known brain metastases.",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have failed prior treatment with a new hormonal agent and have homologous recombination repair gene mutations.",
