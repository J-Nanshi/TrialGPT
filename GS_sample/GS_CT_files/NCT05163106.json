    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Any prior treatment for primary invasive breast cancer \n\n Patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib or letrozole \n\n Patient with known hypersensitivity to peanuts or soya-products \n\n Any evidence of distant metastasis \n\n Triple-negative breast cancer \n\n HER-2 positive disease, suitable for neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and taxanes, etc. \n\n Other conditions rendering patients in need of other treatment options with immediate effect like chemotherapy \n\n Concomitant medications that are known strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 \n\n Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormality, including any of the following: History of documented myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months prior to study entry; documented cardiomyopathy; Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) < 50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO); Long QT syndrome or family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome, or any of the following: Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypocalcemia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia, Concomitant medication(s) with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication (e.g., within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) or Inability to determine the QTcF interval; Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV block); Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) >160 or <90 mmHg \n\n Patient is currently receiving or has received systemic corticosteroids \u2264 2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment. Note: The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: a short duration (<5 days) of systemic corticosteroids; any duration of topical applications (e.g. for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intraarticular). \n\n Pregnant or breast-feeding (lactating) women or women who plan to become pregnant or breast-feed during the trial \n\n Women of child-bearing potential defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 21 days after stopping the treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment; Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient and the success of the vasectomy must be medically confirmed as per local practice; Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD); Note: Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), transdermal, injected, implanted, hormone containing intrauterine systems (IUS) or any other hormonal methods of contraception is not allowed in this study \n\n Autoimmune disorders or significant allergies (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, psoriasis, etc.) \n\n Known HIV infection, Hepatitis B or C infection (testing not mandatory) \n\n History of autoimmune celiac, inflammatory bowel disease, or other chronic GI disease \n\n Recent use (within past month) of more than 3 days of antibiotics use \n\n Current use of probiotic supplements \n\n Taking proton pump inhibitors, steroids, other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or acetyl salicylic acid \n\n Past bariatric surgery",
    "brief_summary": "Patients with locally advanced (stage III) breast cancer (LABC) are characterized by a significantly worse prognosis compared to patients with primarily operable breast cancer. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been the first choice in this situation for several decades, recent evidence suggests that some patients may experience an extraordinary effect from neoadjuvant endocrine treatments involving aromatase inhibitors as monotherapy or in modern drug combinations.Selected LABC patients admitted for treatment will be offered combination therapy including letrozole and ribociclib. The overall goal of the project is to improve understanding of tumor responses and resistance in patients suffering from ER-positive/HER-2 negative locally advanced breast cancer, focusing on the role of the immune system including the gut microbiome.",
