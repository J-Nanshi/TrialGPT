    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.~PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and to see how well it works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing surgery.",
