    "brief_summary": "In 2020, the incidence of breast cancer surpassed that of lung cancer for the first time, becoming the number one cancer in the world. HER2 is an important prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for breast cancer. HER2-overexpressing breast cancer accounts for about 20% to 30% of all breast cancer patients. Targeted therapy for HER2 protein is the core treatment for this type of breast cancer. At present, the neoadjuvant treatment mode of trastuzumab and pertuzumab dual-target chemotherapy has become the standard neoadjuvant treatment for high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer. For patients with early-stage high-risk or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, whether standard neoadjuvant regimen without anthracycline can achieve the same therapeutic effect compared with regimen containing anthracycline is still inconclusive.Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of two neoadjuvant treatment regimens, TCbHP*6 and ECHP*4-THP*4, in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer through a randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trial.",
