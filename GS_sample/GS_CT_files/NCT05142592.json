All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate. \n\n Subjects who are unable to comply with study and follow-up procedures",
    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase 1, Multi-center, Non-randomized, Open-label, Dose-escalation, and Dose Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of IPG7236 Administered Orally as a Single Agent in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.~The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2). Each part will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end of treatment visit and a safety follow-up of approximately 30 days after the last dose. IPG7236 will be given on an empty stomach (either one hour before or two hours after a meal) twice daily (approximately every 12 hours) in continuous 28-day cycles.",
