    "exclusion_criteria": " \n\n Any uncontrolled neurological symptom attributed to CNS metastasis \n\n Brain metastasis must not be impending herniation or other significant vasogenic edema requiring increasing steroid doses; lesions must not have frank hemorrhage \n\n Patients with leptomeningeal disease are not eligible for participation \n\n Patients have been treated with WBRT. The selected intracranial target lesion has received local treatment (surgical resection or SRS). Acute effects related to surgery or SRS have not recover \n\n Any significant medical illnesses or infection that, in the investigator's opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy are not eligible for participation \n\n Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status \n\n Known active hepatitis B and/or C \n\n Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction to one of the compounds or incorporated substances used in this protocol; AND/OR patients who have had prior exposure to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib or lapatinibpyrotinib and PD during treatment are not eligible. \n\n Patients being treated with any other experimental agents/clinical trials are not eligible for participation; if the patient is on any investigational agent, a wash-out period of minimum 2 weeks prior to registration is mandatory for the patient to be eligible for the study \n\n Inability to swallow capsules, malabsorption syndrome or gastrointestinal disease that severely affects the absorption of study drugs, major resection of the stomach or small bowel, or gastric bypass procedure \n\n Patients who have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to any of the following, are not eligible: \n\n Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment \n\n Symptomatic congestive heart failure \n\n Unstable angina pectoris \n\n Cardiac arrhythmia: except atrial fibrillation (AF) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that are controlled by medication \n\n Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements \n\n Any other illness or condition that the treating investigator feels would interfere with study compliance or would compromise the patient's safety or study endpoints",
