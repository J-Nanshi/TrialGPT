Individuals participating in observational studies are eligible. \n\n Have previously received topoisomerase 1 inhibitors or antibody drug conjugates containing a topoisomerase inhibitor. \n\n Have an active second malignancy. \n\n Have active serious infection requiring antibiotics. \n\n Individuals positive for HIV-1 or 2 with a history of Kaposi sarcoma and/or Multicentric Castleman Disease. \n\n Have active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. \n\n Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years. \n\n Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/",
