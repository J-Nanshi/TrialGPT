    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an adjuvant treatment of therapeutic cancer vaccine (AST-301, pNGVL3-hICD) in patients with HER2-low expression (IHC 1+ or 2+ and ISH-) and hormone receptor-negative(ER-, PR-) breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment.~Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the Experimental arm (combination of AST-301/rhuGM CSF and standard adjuvant therapy) or the Control arm (combination of placebo/rhuGM CSF and standard adjuvant therapy). Standard adjuvant chemotherapy will be pembrolizumab or capecitabine.~Adjuvant therapy will be administered in compliance with the NCCN guideline for breast cancer (Version 8, 2021), and IP (AST-301) will be administered 3 times every 3 weeks in the adjuvant treatment period, with a booster administered at 24 weeks (\u00b17 days) post the third dose of IP administration.~Survival follow up will be performed to determine invasive Disease Free survival(iDFS).",
