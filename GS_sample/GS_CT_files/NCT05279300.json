For dose expansion, with at least one measurable lesion as defined per RECIST v1.1 solid tumor or per 2014 Lugano Classification Criteria for lymphoma, respectively. \n\n Life expectancy > 3 months. \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. \n\n Have adequate organ function. \n\n Is willing to provide tumor tissue and control blood sample. \n\n Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. \n\n Both male and female subjects must be willing to use adequate contraception. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Has disease that is suitable for local treatment administered with curative intent. For lymphoma, candidacy for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on the Investigator's judgment. \n\n Has a history of a second malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured. \n\n For dose expansion: Participation in other studies involving therapies targeting ROR1 prior to study entry and/or during study participation. \n\n Has known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or solid tumor CNS metastasis that is either symptomatic, untreated, or requires therapy. \n\n Has other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions. \n\n Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency, or has an active autoimmune disease or other conditions that require systemic steroid therapy. \n\n Has peripheral edema, pericardial effusion, or ascites indicated for medical intervention or limiting activity of daily life. Or with a known history of peripheral vasculopathies. \n\n Patients with any active infections requiring systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of the study drug. \n\n Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive or have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). \n\n Significant cardiovascular disease within 6 months prior to the first dose of the study drug. \n\n Significant screening electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. \n\n Has received major surgery, chemotherapy, definitive radiotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy, or other anti-cancer therapy within 21 days prior to the administration of the first dose of the study drug. \n\n Administration of a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the administration of the first dose of the study drug. \n\n Has active graft versus host disease. \n\n With known active alcohol or drug abuse. \n\n Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
