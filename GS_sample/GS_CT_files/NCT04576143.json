    "brief_summary": "Recent clinical studies showed that breast cancer patients especially for those with lymph node metastasis may benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy, like adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) q2w\u00d74\u2192 paclitaxel (P) q2w\u00d74. However, the studies on dose-dense (dd) regimen chemotherapy is mostly based on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and the optimum of dose-dense chemotherapy has not been determined for Chinese population with HER2-negative breast cancer patients. In our study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense chemotherapy regimen (dd epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by dd paclitaxel (P)) and conventional chemotherapy (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T)) as preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer in Chinese population.",
