    "brief_summary": "Based on the overwhelming positive response to this survey and the large number of patients being treated with PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in the UPMC system, the investigators are proposing a trial that will randomize patients who have disease stability to stop treatment at 1 year or continue treatment until disease progression. The investigators anticipate that the results of this study will answer questions regarding the optimal duration of treatment. therapy.",
