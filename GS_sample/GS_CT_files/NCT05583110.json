Note: the following uses of corticosteroids are permitted at any time: single doses, topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular). \n\n Radiotherapy within 2 weeks (3 weeks if WBRT) prior to starting study treatment (all acute toxic effects must be resolved to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 grade <1, except toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator\u00b4s discretion). Patients who received prior radiotherapy to >25% of bone marrow are not eligible regardless of when it was administered. \n\n Major surgery or other anti-cancer therapy not previously specified within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment, Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy or surgical procedures to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 grade \u2264 1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator\u00b4s discretion) is mandatory. \n\n Are unable for any reason to undergo MRI of the brain. \n\n Have any of the following with regards to CNS disease: \n\n Any untreated brain lesions >2 cm in size. \n\n Any brain lesion thought to require immediate local therapy, including (but not limited to) a lesion in an anatomic site where increase in size or possible treatment-related edema may pose risk to patient (e.g. brain stem lesions). Patients who undergo local treatment for such lesions identified by screening contrast brain MRI may still be eligible for the study based on criteria described under CNS inclusion criteria 7b. \n\n Known or concurrent leptomeningeal disease as documented by the investigator. \n\n Ongoing use of corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at a total daily dose of >2 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent). \n\n Poorly controlled (> 1/week) generalized or complex partial seizures or manifest neurologic progression due to brain metastases notwithstanding CNS-directed therapy. \n\n Have clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent cardiac events including any of the following: \n\n Ventricular arrhythmia requiring therapy. \n\n Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to first dose of study treatment. \n\n Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as persistent systolic blood pressure > 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg on antihypertensive medications). \n\n Any history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). \n\n History of LVEF decline below 50% during or after prior trastuzumab therapy or other cardiac toxicity during previous trastuzumab treatment that necessitated discontinuation of trastuzumab. \n\n Have a diagnosis of any other malignancy within 3 years prior to inclusion, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or colorectal. \n\n Have history of allergic reactions to trastuzumab, vinorelbine, or tucatinib (or compounds chemically or biologically similar), except for Grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions to trastuzumab or vinorelbine that were successfully managed. \n\n Have difficulties to swallow tablets, malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative diseases). \n\n Have positive serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or active infection for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or have other known chronic liver disease. \n\n Other severe acute or chronic medical (such as neuropathy grade 3-4) or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. \n\n Are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential or partners of women of child-bearing potential, unless agreement to remain abstinent or use of single or combined non-hormonal contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study treatment. \n\n Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. \n\n Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include tubal ligation, male sterilization (only if he is the sole partner and have been performed at least 6 months prior to screening), and certain intrauterine devices. \n\n Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of < 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. \n\n Male participants must not donate sperm during study and up to the time period specified above.",
    "brief_summary": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in the world. In Spain, one in 8 women is diagnosed with BC. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC subtype (that represents around 20% of all BC) was associated with poor prognosis however, new therapeutic advances have significantly increased the cure rate of patients in early stages.~In the metastatic setting, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have significantly improved overall survival (OS) with good quality of life, however there is still a substantial group of patients who die, and therefore additional drugs need to be investigated.~Trastuzumab, an anti HER2 antibody has demonstrated, in combination with chemotherapy, an improvement of OS in early and metastatic stages.~Tucatinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase subunit. Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).~Vinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.~This is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.",
