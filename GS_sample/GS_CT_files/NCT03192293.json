    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective single arm open-label Phase 2 study utilising the combination of Fulvestrant, Metformin and Simvastatin in post-menopausal ER-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the primary endpoint being Clinical Benefit Rate (defined as complete response, partial response or stable disease, equal to or more than 24 weeks). The hypothesis is that the addition of Metformin and Simvastatin to Fulvestrant will improve the Clinical Benefit Rate from 40% (historical data from control arm of PALOMA-3 study) to 60%. A total of 28 patients will be enrolled over a period of 24 months. Eligible patients will receive 500 mg Fulvestrant by intramuscular injection on days 1 and 15 of cycle one and then on day one of each subsequent cycle (28 days). Patients will be given 850mg oral Metformin twice-a-day (based on xenograft models which showed that Metformin had anti-tumor effects at a minimum dose of 1500mg per day), and 20mg oral Simvastatin every night (drawing reference from the investigators' group's window-of-opportunity study), daily throughout the cycle. As part of the in-build safety and tolerability design, all patients will have a lead-in period of 7 days where they receive 850mg oral Metformin twice-a-day and 20mg oral Simvastatin every night. Special adverse events of interest include lactic acidosis, diarrhea, bloatedness, transaminitis and rhabdomyolysis. If no dose-limiting toxic effects (DLT) occur, Fulvestrant will be commenced, and considered the start of cycle 1. If DLT occurs in any of the patients, the combination of Metformin and Simvastatin will be modified for the affected patient as per protocol, with further monitoring for another 7 days. This combination will be deemed safe for that patient if no DLT occurs, following which cycle 1 can officially commence.~At the time of study entry, blood samples will be drawn to establish baseline physiological parameters including fasting insulin, glucose, lipids and Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2). In patients who have accessible tumor sites and are willing to provide tissue for translational research, pre- and post-treatment (at end of 8 weeks) biopsies will be taken for correlative biomarker studies. Patients will be evaluated on an 8-weekly basis for toxicities and efficacy assessments during the first 6 months of treatment, followed by 12-weekly thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or patient withdrawal.",
