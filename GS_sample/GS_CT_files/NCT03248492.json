    "brief_summary": "Some human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) breast cancer patients do not respond or become resistant to current treatment. DS-8201a is a new experimental product that is a combination of an antibody and a drug. It has not yet been approved for use. DS-8201a may slow down tumor growth. This might improve outcomes for these patients.",
