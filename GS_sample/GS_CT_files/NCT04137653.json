    "brief_summary": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 20% of clinical breast cancer. Clinical characteristics include early onset, high malignancy and heterogeneity. There is no effective drug target for TNBC, resulting in poor outcomes, high relapse rate and distant metastasis. So, further research on TNBC pathological features is particularly important.~Compared with the solvent-based paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-P) demonstrates a stronger therapeutic effect. With albumin nanoparticles as a carrier, nab-P increases the concentration of extra-tumor drugs by passing through the albumin receptor (Gp60) transmembrane pathway and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) approach that binds to the extracellular matrix of the tumor. Numerous clinical trials have found that nab-P is superior to the solvent-based paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer, especially in breast cancer with poor prognosis. However, the current efficacy of nab-P in the treatment of TNBC has not been fully verified. The mechanism underlying the killing effect of nab-P on TNBC breast cancer cells remains unclear yet. This trial will compare the therapeutic effect of nab-P with solvent-based paclitaxel in TNBC patients, and seek for important scientific clues, scientific evidence, and clinical data for nab-P in the treatment of TNBC.",
