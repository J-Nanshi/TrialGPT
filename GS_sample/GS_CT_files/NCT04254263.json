    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Metastatic disease (Stage IV) ; \n\n Gross residual disease remaining after mastectomy or positive margins after breast-conserving surgery; \n\n Progressive disease during neoadjuvant therapy; \n\n Subjects that are unable to swallow tablets, or dysfunction of gastrointestinal absorption; \n\n Treated or treating with anti-HER2 TKI, including but not limited to pyrotinib, lapatinib and neratinib. \n\n Less than 4 weeks from the last clinical trial; \n\n History of immunodeficiency, including HIV-positive, suffering from other acquired, congenital immunodeficiency disease, or history of organ transplantation; \n\n Subjects had any heart disease, including: (1) angina; (2) requiring medication or clinically significant arrhythmia; (3) myocardial infarction; (4) heart failure; (5) Any heart diseases judged by investigator as unsuitable to participate in the trial; \n\n Female patients who are pregnancy, lactation or women who are of childbearing potential tested positive in baseline pregnancy test;Female patients of childbearing age that are reluctant to take effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial period; \n\n Evidence of significant medical illness that in the investigator's judgment will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of the study.",
    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, randomised, multicenter, no placebo-controlled, open label study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in women with residual invasive HER2-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 target therapy. The main purpose is to investigate whether pyrotinib can further reduce the risk of recurrence from previously diagnosed HER-2 positive breast cancer based on the 1-year trastuzumab standard adjuvant treatment with or without pertuzumab.",
