OR: Pre-menopausal patients: \n\n confirmed negative serum pregnancy test (\u03b2-hCG) before starting study treatment, or \n\n patient has had a hysterectomy. 5. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive (> 1%) early breast cancer by local laboratory. \n\n 6. Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as \n\n a negative in-situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+, or 2+, \n\n if IHC is 2+, a negative in-situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required (based on the most recently analyzed tissue sample and all tested by a local laboratory). \n\n 7. Local therapy of breast cancer (if adjuvant treatment or planned if neoadjuvant treatment) according to current guidelines. \n\n Note: This may include radiotherapy of breast cancer. \n\n B. Prior to RANDOMIZATION in the study 8. No evidence of distant metastasis (confirmed prior to randomization by, preferentially, CT thorax / abdomen, X-ray chest, ultrasound liver, bone scan, or PET-CT). \n\n 9. Patient has available tumor tissue from diagnostic biopsy. 10. Patient is classified as intermediate risk according to the ADAPT intermediate-risk definition (i) (as follows), or (only in case of missing Oncotype DX or Ki-67 response data), according to the clinical intermediate-risk definition (ii) (as follows). \n\n (i). ADAPT intermediate-risk definition: Patient meets one of the following criteria: \n\n c/pN0, RS \u2264 25 with luminal-B-like (Ki-67 \u226520% or G3) or c/pT2-4 without endocrine response (post-endocrine Ki-67 > 10 %) \n\n c/pN1, RS \u2264 25 without endocrine response (post-endocrine Ki-67 > 10 %) \n\n c/pN0, RS > 25 with luminal-B-like (Ki-67 \u226520% or G3) or c/pT2-4 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %) \n\n c/pN1, RS > 25 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %) \n\n c/pN2-3, RS \u2264 25 with endocrine response (Ki-67 \u2264 10 %). Note: Postmenopausal patients with pT1-2/pN0 disease and RS < 25, as well as premenopausal patients with pT1-2/pN0 disease and RS<16, are recommended to be treated by endocrine therapy alone and not to be randomized (at investigator\u00b4s discretion). \n\n (ii). Clinical intermediate-risk definition (ascertained by investigator): Clinical intermediate risk may be ascertained by the investigator prior to randomization if at maximum two of the following three risk factors are present (according to primary diagnosis / 1st sample): \n\n cT2-4 \n\n c/pN positive \n\n G3 and / or Ki-67 \u2265 20% Note: Inclusion of a patient according to clinical intermediate risk is permitted only in case of missing baseline Oncotype DX\u00ae or Ki-67 decrease.
