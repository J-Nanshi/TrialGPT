    "brief_summary": "This phase II study assesses the efficacy of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab, selumetinib, or capivasertib or ceralasertib alone in the treatment of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Olaparib may stop growth of tumor cells by inhibiting some of the enzymes (ADP ribose polymerase [PARP]) needed for cell growth. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits the growth and spread of tumors by stimulating the patient's antitumor immune response. Selumetinib, capivasertib, and ceralasertib are inhibitor drugs that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes (MEK, AKT, ATR) needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib together with durvalumab, selumetinib, or capivasertib or giving ceralasertib alone may provide an effective method to treat patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",
