Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin greater than 10g/dl (patients may receive transfusions to meet this parameter). \n\n Total bilirubin < 1.5 times upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater than 70 ml/min/1.73m. \n\n Seronegative for HIV antibody. \n\n Seronegative for active hepatitis B, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. \n\n Patients must be willing to practice birth control during and for four months following treatment. NOTE: women of child-bearing age must have evidence of negative pregnancy test. \n\n Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients with life expectancy less than 12 months will be excluded. \n\n Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (> 160/95), unstable coronary disease evidenced by uncontrolled arrhythmias, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure (> New York Heart Association Class II), or myocardial infarction within 6 months of study will be excluded. \n\n Patients with any of the following pulmonary function abnormalities will be excluded: FEV(forced expiratory volume), < 30% predicted; DLCO (diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide) < 30% predicted (post-bronchodilator); Oxygen Saturation less than 90% on room air. \n\n Patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction or consciousness disorders will be excluded. \n\n Pregnant and/or lactating women will be excluded. \n\n Patients with active infections, including HIV, will be excluded, due to unknown effects of the vaccine on lymphoid precursors. \n\n Patients with any type of primary immunodeficiencies will be excluded from the study. \n\n Patients requiring corticosteroids (other than inhaled) will be excluded. \n\n Patients with history of T cell tumors will be excluded. \n\n Patients who are participating or participated any other clinical trials in latest 30 days will be excluded.",
    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.~PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in treating patients with Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory Advanced Malignancies.",
