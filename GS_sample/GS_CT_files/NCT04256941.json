Highly effective contraception methods include combination of any two of the following: placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository; total abstinence or; male/female sterilization \n\n Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate contraception, during the study and for 8 weeks after the end of treatment",
    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well letrozole, anastrozole, or fulvestrant work when given together with ribociclib, palbociclib, and/or abemaciclib in treating patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and has an ERS1 activating mutation. Letrozole, anastrozole, ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. It is not yet known if giving letrozole, anastrozole, or fulvestrant with ribociclib, palbociclib, and/or abemaciclib will work better in treating patients with breast cancer.",
