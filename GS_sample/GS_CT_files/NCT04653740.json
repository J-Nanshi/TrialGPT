    "brief_summary": "This is a monocentric cohort study, prospective and interventional with minimal risks and constraints for advanced breast cancer. The planned interventions are collection of biological samples at different times. The study will aim to do a descriptive analysis of omics profiles evolution (tumor, volatile organic components) over time, before and after disease progression under Palbociclib treatment with a clinical-biological database.",
