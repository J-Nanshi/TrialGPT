    "brief_summary": "DF1001-001 is a study of a new molecule that targets natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell activation signals to specific receptors on cancer cells. The study will occur in two phases. The first phase will be a dose escalation phase, enrolling patients with various types of solid tumors that express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Two combination therapy cohorts will be opened for enrollment, DF1001 + nivolumab and DF1001 + Nab paclitaxel. The second phase will include a dose expansion using the best dose selected from the first phase of the study. Multiple cohorts will be opened with eligible patients having either selected solid tumors, or solid tumors expressing high levels of HER2.",
