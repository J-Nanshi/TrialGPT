Blastic-only lesions in bone are not considered assessable. \n\n ECOG/ WHO performance status 0 to 1, with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks inclusion criteria for the paired tumour biopsy research: \n\n inclusion criteria for the paired tumour biopsy research \n\n Disease suitable for paired baseline and on-study tumour biopsies \n\n Washout from prior fulvestrant: 6 months \n\n Washout from prior tamoxifen: 4 months \n\n Signed written informed consent for tumour biopsies \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": " \n\n Intervention with any of the following \n\n Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents/other anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of advanced breast cancer from a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14 days of the first dose of IMP \n\n Concomitant medications or herbal supplements known to be strong inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5, sensitive CYP2B6 substrates, and drugs which are sensitive substrates of CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19, and which have a narrow therapeutic index. In addition: Parts E and F will exclude the concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 and/or Pgp inhibitors; Parts G H, I, J, K and L will exclude the concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers; Parts I and J will exclude concomitant use of sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index. \n\n Drugs known to prolong QT and known risk of Torsades de Pointes \n\n Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of IMP, except patients receiving radiotherapy to more than 30% of the bone marrow/a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of IMP \n\n Major surgical procedure/significant traumatic injury, as judged by the investigator, within 4 weeks of the first dose of IMP, or an anticipated need for major surgery and/or any surgery requiring general anaesthesia during the study. \n\n Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy > CTCAE Grade 1 at the time of starting IMP, with the exception of alopecia. \n\n Presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, as judged by the investigator, uncontrolled CNS metastatic disease.
