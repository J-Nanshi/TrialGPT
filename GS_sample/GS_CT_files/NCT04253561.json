All subjects who are biologically capable of having children must agree and commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control from 2 weeks before administration of the first dose of investigational product until 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. \n\n Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial. \n\n ",
