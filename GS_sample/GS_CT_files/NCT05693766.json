    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n PIK3CA mutation \n\n Prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting \n\n More than 1 line of prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting \n\n Radiation therapy \u2264 2 weeks prior to study entry. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy must have recovered from toxicity (\u2264 grade 1) induced by this treatment (except for alopecia) \n\n Previous malignant disease other than breast cancer within the last 5 years, with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, or low-risk cancers considered curatively treated (i.e. complete remission achieved at least 2 years prior to first dose of study drugs AND additional therapy not required while receiving study treatment). \n\n Symptomatic brain metastases (patients with a history of brain metastases must be clinically stable for more than 4 weeks from completion of radiation treatment and off steroids) \n\n Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy that has not reduced to Grade 1 [National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0]; however, alopecia and sensory neuropathy Grade \u2264 2 is acceptable. \n\n Pregnant or breastfeeding females.",
