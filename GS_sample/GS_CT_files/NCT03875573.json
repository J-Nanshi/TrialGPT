In addition, only tumours with Proliferation Index Ki67 \u2265 15% or histology grade III are accepted. \n\n Agreement to perform new study related biopsies to provide tissue samples \n\n MammaPrint genomic high risk score according to centralised testing, except for specific conditions as mentioned below. Mammaprint will only be tested for luminal B breast tumours with either Proliferation Index Ki67 \u2265 15% or histology grade III tumours. (Testing to be done during screening period). \n\n MammaPrint result status at time of termination of all other screening procedures \n\n MammaPrint is high risk: subject may be randomized. \n\n MammaPrint is low risk: subjet can not be randomized. \n\n MammaPrint result is not yet known: \n\n If the MammaPrint result is not known at time of termination of all other screening procedures, the investigator is allowed to randomize the subject and start study treatment without waiting for the result of the MammaPrint in the following situations: (Ki67 > 20 % or grade III) and Age<50 years+ cN0 OR Age \u2265 50 years + cN+ \u2022 Tumour size: \n\n If subject is cN0: tumour size \u2265 2 cm, as determined by MRI imaging. \n\n If subject is cN1, cN2 or cN3: tumour size \u2265 1.5 cm, as determined by MRI imaging. \n\n The requirement for an MRI is not applicable in the case of medical contraindications to perform MRI (e.g., obesity or claustrophobia). In this situation, tumour evaluations should be performed by ultrasound. \n\n Multifocal, multicentric unilateral or bilateral breast adenocarcinoma tumours are allowed provided that all biopsiable foci are ER+/HER2- according to local testing and all foci are able to receive SBRT treatment within the defined dosimetric constraints. In some cases a separate biopsy of every focus is not mandatory, but only if every of the following conditions are present: \n\n -small focal lesion \n\n -lesion in close proximity to the main primary cancer from which a biopsy was taken \n\n the investigator and the radiologist consider the lesion to be clearly related to the main primary breast cancer from which a biopsy was taken \n\n the lesion will be removed during the same lumpectomy than the main primary breast cancer For bilateral, multifocal or multicentric disease, the site selected for pre-treatment biopsy should correspond to the site of largest measurable disease meeting eligibility criteria. The location of tumour biopsy site (laterality, quadrant, position from the nipple and type of imaging modality to guide biopsy) should be collected. \n\n Serum pregnancy test (for subjects of childbearing potential) negative within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study administration. \n\n Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 highly effective method of contraception during the screening period, during the course of the study and at least 12 months after the last administration of study treatment. it is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. \n\n Adequate bone marrow function as defined below: \n\n Absolute neutrophil count \u22651500/\u00b5L, i.e. 1.5x10^9/L \n\n Hemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL \n\n Platelets \u2265100000/\u00b5L, i.e. 100x10^9/L \n\n Adequate liver function as defined below: \n\n - Serum total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN. In case of known Gilbert's syndrome \u2264 3 x UNL is allowed \n\n - AST (SGOT) \u2264 3.0 x ULN \n\n ALT (SGPT) \u2264 3.0 x ULN \n\n Adequate renal function as defined below: \n\n Creatinine \u2264 1.5 x UNL or eGFR \u2265 40ml/min/1.73m\u00b2 \n\n Adequate coagulant function as defined below: \n\n International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2264 1.5 x ULN \n\n Completion of all necessary screening procedures within 28 days prior to randomisation (except if written differently). \n\n Willingness to provide tissue and blood samples for immuno-monitoring and translational research activities \n\n Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50%. LVEF performed in routine is accepted if done within 6 months prior to beginning of screening. \n\n Signed Informed Consent form (ICF) obtained prior to any study related procedure. \n\n Inclusion criterion for phase II only (all phase II subjects): \n\n \u2022 Tumour sample provided for central PD-L1 IHC assessment. (Testing done during screening period). \n\n Inclusion criterion applicable to FRANCE only (all safety run-in and phase II subject): \n\n \u2022 Affiliated to the French Social Security System (applicable only to subjects treated in France) \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Pregnant and/or lactating women. \n\n Subject with a significant medical, neuro-psychiatric, substance abuse or surgical condition, currently uncontrolled by treatment, which, in the principal investigator's opinion, may interfere with completion of the study. \n\n TNM stage cT4 breast cancer including inflammatory breast cancer \n\n Presence of any distant metastasis \n\n Contra-indication for treatment by paclitaxel, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide, or known allergy to any tested substances or any excipients (e.g; chemotherapy or immunotherapy formulations). Contra-indication for subjects with known sensitivity to acetaminophen/paracetamol, diphenhydramine or equivalent antihistamine (this is a contra-indication for treatment with oleclumab). \n\n Previously known contra-indication for treatment by radiation therapy such as rare genetic disorders associated with DNA repair disorders such as ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) and Fanconi anemia. \n\n Active or prior documented autoimmune disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner's granulomatosis) within the past 3 years.

    "brief_summary": "Neo-CheckRay is a multicenter, open-label phase II study that randomizes luminal B breast cancer subjects candidate for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in a 1:1:1 ratio in 3 arms:~the combination of weekly paclitaxel followed by dose-dense doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (ddAC) and pre-operative radiation therapy (boost dose) on the primary tumour~arm 1 with the addition of the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab~arm 2 with the addition of the anti-CD73 antibody oleclumab The primary tumour will be excised 2-6 weeks after completion of ddAC. A safety run-in is planned for the 6 first subjects before starting the randomized phase II trial. Those 6 subjects will receive the treatment given in Arm 3.",
