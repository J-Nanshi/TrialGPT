    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE:~The combination of anti-angiogenic targeted therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to further improve the pathologic response rate for HER2-negative breast cancer patients. Apatinib is a highly potent human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been independently developed in China, and it can exert anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting VEGFR2. It is unknown whether giving combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy together with apatinib is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.~PURPOSE:~To explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib added to weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin neoadjuvant therapy for HER-2 negative breast cancer patients",
