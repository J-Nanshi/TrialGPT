    "brief_summary": "This was a multicenter, open, multi-cohort extended PHASE I/IIa study, consisting of 2 phases:Phase I (Phase I dose escalation) and Phase II (Phase IIa multi-cohort extension). The objective of this study was to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and initial efficacy in malignant pleural mesothelioma and MSLN in advanced malignant solid tumors.",
