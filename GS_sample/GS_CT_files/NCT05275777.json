    "brief_summary": "This is an open label, lead in phase Ib dose confirmation study in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a phase II single arm study as neoadjuvant therapy in stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer.~Primary Objectives~To determine the safety profile of combination of ADG106 with dose dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, and with weekly paclitaxel.~To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ADG106 in combination with dose dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, and with weekly paclitaxel.~To evaluate biological changes on immunohistochemistry in HER2 negative breast cancer after treatment with ADG106 alone and in combination with chemotherapy.~Secondary Objectives~To determine the efficacy of combination of ADG106 with standard neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy in HER2 negative breast cancer: objective response rates.~To correlate tumor and plasma biomarkers with efficacy outcomes.",
