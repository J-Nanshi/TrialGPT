    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Age >= 18 years. Children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials \n\n For the six-patient safety cohort, subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors that are metastatic or recurrent, and require palliative systemic treatment, for which there are either Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications for XL184 (cabozantinib) or nivolumab or have at least phase 2 data clearly indicating activity (such as renal cell carcinoma [RCC], hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], medullary thyroid carcinoma [MTC], melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], head and neck cancer, urothelial carcinoma, small cell lung cancer [SCLC], radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, castration-resistant prostate carcinoma [CRPC], and triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]). Subjects must have progressed, or are intolerant, or decline systemic therapy associated with clinically significant survival benefit if checkpoint blockade is not an approved or accepted treatment. The expansion cohort is limited to subjects with KS. Histologic, cytologic, and pathologic confirmation of KS is required \n\n Any number of prior cancer therapies will be permitted, including treatment naive subjects. (Note: For KS, treatment naive asymptomatic subjects will be permitted. But treatment naive KS subjects with visceral symptomatic disease or complicated KS HHV 8 disease including Castleman's disease will be excluded and should receive front-line standard of care) \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 (Karnofsky >= 80%) \n\n Subjects with tumors other than KS must have evaluable disease \n\n Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/mcL \n\n Platelets >= 75,000/mcL \n\n Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (If, however, the participant has Gilbert's disease or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is considered to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, then the total bilirubin must be =< 3 x ULN) \n\n Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 3 x institutional ULN \n\n Creatinine =< 1.5 institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) \n\n Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL \n\n CD4 count >= 50/mcL \n\n Subjects must have known HIV infection as below: Serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive Western blot, or any other federally approved licensed HIV test. Alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the participant has HIV infection based on prior ELISA and Western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests. Subjects must receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection. An eligible patient should be on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) that is not strongly CYP3A4 inhibiting or otherwise prohibited by the protocol (e.g. drug-drug interactions) or the patient must be converted to one of these regimens before starting investigational therapy in order to avoid dose modulation of cabozantinib \n\n Life expectancy of >= 12 weeks \n\n For subjects with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated \n\n Subjects with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured including self-cured cases. For subjects with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load \n\n Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial \n\n The effects of nivolumab and XL184 (cabozantinib) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of investigational drug. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the start of receiving the first dose of the study medication. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception \n\n Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL \n\n Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Subjects with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible \n\n ",

Note: Complete resolution of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more than 6 months before \n\n Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement within 3 months before the first dose of study therapy \n\n Subjects with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to subjects with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and subjects with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Subjects with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and subjects with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.

Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible \n\n The subject is unable to swallow tablets \n\n History of organ transplant or stem cell transplant \n\n Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness \n\n Subjects with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements \n\n Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib) or nivolumab",
    "brief_summary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects of cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating patients with cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) and who are undergoing treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and nivolumab may shrink or stabilize cancer in patients undergoing treatment for HIV.",
