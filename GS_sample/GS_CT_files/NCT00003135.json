    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia may kill more tumor cells.~PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fluorouracil and liposomal doxorubicin together with systemic hyperthermia works in treating patients with metastatic breast, ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer.",
