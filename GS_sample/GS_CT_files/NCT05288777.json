    "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in high-risk breast cancer patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before their lumpectomy and/or mastectomy and were found to have residual disease. As well as examine the effects of this treatment combination on the immune system.",
