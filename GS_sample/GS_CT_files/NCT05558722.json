    "brief_summary": "Anlotinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that strongly inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and c-kit. Combining anti-angiogenesis with chemotherapy yielded increased response rates in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding anlotinib to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated stage \u2161B-IIIA histologically documented (HER2)-negative breast cancer were assigned to receive chemotherapy plus oral Anlotinib. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) (no invasive carcinoma in breast or axilla). Secondary end points included safety and disease-free survival (DFS).",
