    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous radiation therapy covering the whole pelvis \n\n Suspected brain metastases, untreated brain metastases or current clinical or radiologic progression of known brain metastases or requirement for steroid therapy for brain metastases \n\n Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they have been stable and off steroids for \u2265 3 weeks \n\n Prior allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplantation \n\n Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of alisertib. Examples include, but are not limited to partial gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease \n\n Known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; requirement for supplemental oxygen. \n\n Requirement for administration of proton pump inhibitor, or for constant administration of H2 antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes.

Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum B-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening, within 72 hours prior to first dose of study drug(s). Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women. \n\n Patient has received an investigational agent within 30 days before enrollment \n\n Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study. \n\n Other severe acute or chronic medical and/or psychiatric condition(s), including but not limited to uncontrolled diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small bowel, requirement for pancreatic enzymes, any condition that would modify small bowel absorption of oral medications, or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient not eligible for enrollment for this study. \n\n Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or an in situ malignancy, or a stage I cancer with a 5-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) of \u2265 90% (survival rates by stage are available for most cancers on the American Cancer Society website). \n\n Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as the enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, or rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and during the study. \n\n Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

Replacement doses of hydrocortisone up to 15 mg/day are allowed. \n\n Inability to swallow oral medication or inability or unwillingness to comply with the administration requirements related to alisertib. \n\n Administration of myeloid growth factors or platelet transfusion within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. \n\n More than 1 previous chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease \n\n No limit on previous endocrine therapy \n\n Previous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) therapy, e.g., everolimus, is allowed \n\n Prior adjuvant taxane therapy is allowed, provided the disease-free interval from the end of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy to the development of metastatic disease was \u2265 1 year \n\n No prior taxane for metastatic disease \n\n Peripheral neuropathy > grade 1 \n\n Known severe hypersensitivity to paclitaxel",
    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, alisertib, in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel), can shrink or slow tumor growth in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative or HR-negative, HER2-negative (triple negative) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of breast cancer.~Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the activity of Aurora A kinase, a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this protein can lead to the death of cancer cells.~Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer, including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in cancer therapy, combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of the same drugs used alone.",
