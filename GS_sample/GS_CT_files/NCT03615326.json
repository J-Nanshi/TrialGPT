    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Has had previous therapy for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric/GEJ cancer \n\n Has had major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study treatment \n\n Has had radiotherapy within 14 days of randomization \n\n Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 5 years \n\n Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis \n\n Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years \n\n Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy \n\n Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis \n\n Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis) \n\n Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy \n\n Has poorly controlled diarrhea \n\n Accumulation of pleural, ascitic, or pericardial fluid requiring drainage or diuretic drugs within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. If the participant is receiving diuretic drugs for other reasons, it is acceptable \n\n Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator \n\n Has peripheral neuropathy > Grade 1 \n\n Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial \n\n A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to randomization or treatment allocation \n\n Has active or clinically significant cardiac disease \n\n Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) \n\n Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection \n\n Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265Grade 3) to pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, study chemotherapy agents and/or to any excipients, murine proteins, or platinum-containing products \n\n Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant \n\n Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], OX 40, Cluster of Differentiation 137 [CD137])",
    "brief_summary": "The study will compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab in combination with standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with SOC chemotherapy in participants with HER2-positive gastric cancer. The primary hypotheses of the study are that pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy is superior to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in terms of 1) progression free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), and 2) overall survival (OS).",
