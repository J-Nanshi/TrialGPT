    "brief_summary": "Studies have shown that dose-dense chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence and death of breast cancer patients comparing with standard-schedule chemotherapy. But some research data indicate that HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy while some have negative results. How to identify HR+/HER2 breast cancer patients who are more likely to benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy is strongly necessary. Ki67 is a marker reflecting the proliferation of tumor cells. Breast cancer patients with high Ki67 are more likely to benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy. The purpose of this project is to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy for HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients with high proliferation index. At the same time, we will explore biomarkers, such as MammaPrint and BluePrint, to further identify patients who benefit more from neoadjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy.",
