Tumor must be HER2- as defined by ASCO-CAP guidelines \n\n Patients must have progressed on fulvestrant as a preceding treatment line (as first or second line therapy) \n\n Previous treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the advanced setting \n\n The presence of an activating PIK3CA mutation \n\n Evaluable disease* as defined per RECIST v.1.1 \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2 \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "The study is a nationwide, multicenter single-arm phase 2 study. The current phase 2 study investigates the efficacy of the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib directly after progression on fulvestrant (either in first or second line, with or without previous use of CDK4/6-inhibitor) in patients with HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer with PIK3CA mutated tumors.~All eligible patients must have progressive disease on fulvestrant as latest treatment line.~Previous treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in first or second line is obligatory. After progressive disease is confirmed, it is important to continue fulvestrant (without CDK4/6 inhibition) during the screening period awaiting study enrollment.~After study enrollment all participants will be treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant beyond progression. Follow-up time will be until progression or death or until a different oncolytic treatment has started (in case no progressive disease during previous fulvestrant and alpelisib treatment has been documented).~Should participants discontinue due to reasons other than progression or death (e.g. toxicity), then they should still be evaluated for disease progression every 8 weeks as per protocol until progression, unless they do not wish to proceed with these screenings, or receive a different oncolytic treatment.",
