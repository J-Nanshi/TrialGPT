    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Current participation in another therapeutic clinical trial. \n\n Prior treatment with entrectinib. \n\n History of prolonged QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval > 450 milliseconds). \n\n History of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., family history of long QT syndrome). \n\n Known active infections (bacterial, fungal, viral including HIV positivity). \n\n Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption. \n\n Known interstitial lung disease, interstitial fibrosis, or history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced pneumonitis. \n\n Peripheral neuropathy \u2265 Grade 2.",
    "brief_summary": "Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TrkA (coded by the gene NTRK1), TrkB (coded by the gene NTRK2), TrkC (coded by the gene NTRK3), ROS1 (coded by the gene ROS1), and ALK (coded by the gene ALK). Molecular alterations to one or more of these targets are present in several different tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer with a detectable molecular alteration in targets of interest may be eligible for enrollment.~Phase 1 will assess safety and tolerability of entrectinib via standard dose escalation scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Safety and efficacy will be assessed in the dose expansion portion of the study.",
