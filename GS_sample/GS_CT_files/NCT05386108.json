If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST \u22645 \u00d7 ULN \n\n Total serum bilirubin <1.5 \u00d7 ULN except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may be included if the total serum bilirubin is \u22643.0 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \n\n The patient is able and willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. \n\n For Phase 1b, the presence of brain metastases is allowed but not required for eligibility. In Phase 2, patients must have at least one active and measurable brain metastasis per RECIST version 1.1 \n\n Any of the following qualifies brain metastases as active: \n\n Newly diagnosed brain metastasis in patients who never received prior CNS-directed therapy. \n\n Newly diagnosed brain metastasis outside any area that was previously subjected to CNS-directed therapy \n\n Brain metastases that are progressing in an area that has previously been subjected to CNS-directed therapy \n\n For lesions, including brain metastases, to qualify as measurable, and possibly be selected as target lesions, per RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix C), the longest diameter must be \u226510 mm by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "This is a multi-site, global, open-label study that includes a phase 1b evaluation of elacestrant in combination with abemaciclib in women and men with with or without brain metastases from ER-positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer. Phase 1b is designed to select the recommended phase 2 dose and will be followed by a phase 2 evaluation of elacestrant in combination with abemaciclib in patients with active brain metastases from ER-positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer.",
