    "brief_summary": "TQB3909 is an inhibitor targeting B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 protein. By binding to BCL-2 protein, TQB3909 releases Pro apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2-Anatagonist/Killer 1(BAK), BCL-2 associated X (BAX) protein and BCL-2 associated death (BAD) protein, promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, phosphatidylserine eversion, stimulates caspase 3/7 activity and caspase 3/9 cleavage, and induces apoptosis.",
