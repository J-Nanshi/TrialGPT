    "brief_summary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alpha-TEA when given together with trastuzumab and to see how well they work for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer that does not respond to treatment (refractory) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Anti-cancer treatment, such as alpha-TEA, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Alpha-TEA may also alter cancer growth by stimulating the body's immune response against the tumor. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Giving alpha-TEA and trastuzumab may work better for the treatment of HER2+ refractory and metastatic breast cancer compared to usual treatment.",
