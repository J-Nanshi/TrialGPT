    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase II, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of Pyrotinib in combination with Doxorubicin/Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide followed by Docetaxel/nab-Paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy for women with hormone receptor positive HER2-negative stage II to III breast cancer. Patients randomized to the study arm/control arm will receive standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with pyrotinib/placebo, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study is the total pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary endpoints include the pCR rate in breast only, objective response rate(ORR), event-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. We will also explore potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.",
