    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: \n\n Medical condition requiring concomitant administration of a medication with a narrow therapeutic window, that is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450), and for which a dose reduction cannot be considered. \n\n Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor, unless it can be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the first administration of study intervention. \n\n Life expectancy less than 3 months. \n\n Untreated brain metastases or history of leptomeningeal disease. \n\n Significant concomitant illness \n\n History within the last 3 years of an invasive malignancy other than the one treated in this study, with the exception of resected/ablated basal or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other local tumors considered cured by local treatment. \n\n History of known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related illnesses or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease requiring antiretroviral treatment, or active hepatitis A, B or C infection. \n\n Non-resolution of any prior treatment-related toxicity to <Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, or active thyroiditis controlled with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). \n\n Unresolved corneal disorder or any previous corneal disorder considered by an ophthalmologist to predict higher risk of drug-induced keratopathy. \n\n Use of contact lenses. Participants using contact lenses who are not willing to stop wearing them for the duration of the study intervention are excluded. \n\n Concurrent treatment with any other anti cancer therapy. \n\n Washout period before the first administration of study intervention of less than 3 weeks or less than 5 times the half-life, whichever is shorter, for prior antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapy and radiotherapy, or any investigational treatment). \n\n Any prior therapy targeting CEACAM5. \n\n Prior maytansinoid DM4 treatment (ADC). \n\n Any major surgery within the preceding 2 weeks of the first study intervention administration. \n\n Previous enrollment in this study or current participation in any other clinical study involving an investigational study treatment or any other type of medical research. \n\n Poor renal function \n\n Poor hepatic function \n\n Poor bone marrow function \n\n Cohort C: mPAC \n\n - Any previous systemic therapy with taxane or gemcitabine (for Cohort C only). \n\n The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to the potential participation in a clinical trial.",
