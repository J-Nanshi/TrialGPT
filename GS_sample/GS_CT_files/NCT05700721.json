    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n 1. Age \u2265 18 years old. 2. Participant must have brain metastasis and either \n\n 1. Advanced BRCA1/2m cancer 2. Advanced HRR-aberrant, non-BRCA1/2m cancer 3. Advanced small cell lung cancer 4. Advanced non-small cell lung cancer 5. Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer 3. In cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be eligible for this study based on the presence of actionable aberrations in one or more of the following HRR genes: BRCA1/2, ATM; BRIP1; CDK12; CHEK1; CHEK2; FANCL; PALB2; RAD51; RAD51B; RAD51C; RAD51D; RAD52; RAD54L, or other related genes at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy Precision Oncology Decision Support (PODS) group. Variant interpretation for actionability will be performed by PODS. \n\n 4. Any prior SRS to brain lesions or prior excision must have occurred \u22651 week before the start of dosing for this study. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. \n\n 5. Patients must have had at least one prior line of systemic therapy directed at their malignancy. \n\n 6. Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u2264 2. \n\n 7. Adequate organ function as described below: (Note: CBC test should be obtained without transfusion or receipt of colony-stimulating factors in the 2 weeks before obtaining). \n\n Hematological \u2022 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u22651,500 /mcL \n\n \u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000 / mcL \n\n \u2022 Hemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL \n\n \u2022 Serum creatinine \u22641.5xULN OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min for participants. \n\n Hepatic \n\n Serum total bilirubin \u22641.5xULN OR Direct bilirubin \u22641 x ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels \u22651.5xULN ) (if associated with liver metastases or Gilbert's disease, \u22642.5 x ULN) \n\n Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) \u22642.5 x ULN (if associated with liver metastases, \u22645 x ULN) Coagulation \n\n International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) \u22641.5xULN, unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy. \n\n 8. Participant must have at least one measurable brain metastasis (tumor diameter of 0.5-3 cm by mRECIST on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for which all of the following criteria have to be met: asymptomatic (no neurologic signs or symptoms), unirradiated, not requiring immediate local intervention (surgery or radiosurgery), and not requiring systemic glucocorticoid therapy within 10 days prior to study treatment initiation. Patient may have other metastatic lesions which can have had irradiation. \n\n 9. Patients must have archival systemic tumor tissue available at screening. Patients who do not have tissue specimens available may undergo a biopsy during the screening period. Acceptable samples include core-needle biopsies for deep systemic tumor tissue or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks are preferred) OR at least 4 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for testing of tumor PD-L1 expression. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. \n\n 10. Female participant has a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to taking study treatment if of childbearing potential and agrees use a highly effective method of contraception (< 1% failure rate with low user dependency) from screening through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment or is of nonchildbearing potential. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical reasons): \n\n Patients who are \u226545 years of age and who have not had menses for >1 year or have been amenorrhoeic for <2 years without history of a hysterectomy and oophorectomy must have a follicle stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening evaluation \n\n Post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, or post-tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure, otherwise the patient must be willing to use an adequate barrier method throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. See Section 4.4 for a list of acceptable birth control methods. Information must be captured appropriately within the site's source documents. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient. \n\n Participant must agree to not breastfeed during the study or for 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. \n\n 11. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment: \n\n Refrain from donating sperm plus, either: \n\n Be abstinent from sexual activity as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent or \n\n Must agree to use a male condom (and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak) 12. Participant must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject care. Hence, participants must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign the approved written informed consent document. \n\n 13. Participant must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study. \n\n ",
