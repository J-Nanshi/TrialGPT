    "inclusion_criteria": "Registration Stage inclusion criteria: \n\n Women determined to be postmenopausal according to established local criteria. \n\n Diagnosed operable invasive breast cancer with a clinical/radiological tumour size \u22651.5cm* \n\n Preoperative full assessment completed (including bilateral breast examination and imaging with mammogram +/- ultrasound/MRI as performed locally). \n\n Tumour ER positive. ER positivity is defined as >/=1% cells staining positive (or equivalent Allred Score of ER >/=3 out of 8). \n\n Tumour HER2 negative or HER2 status unknown. HER2 negativity will be defined as per the 2018 ASCO/CAP updated guidelines. Patients whose HER2 status is pending/unknown at the time of registration will be allowed to register to the trial. However, please note that only patients who are confirmed to be HER2 negative will be eligible to join the randomised part. \n\n Received or planned to receive 10 days to 6 months of anastrozole or letrozole prior to surgery. \n\n Written informed consent to enter the registration stage of the trial and to donation of fresh tissue. \n\n The patient has given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures and is willing and able to make herself available for the duration of the study and amenable and able to follow study schedule during treatment and follow-up and for the use of routinely collected electronic health and related records. \n\n For patients who enter the trial after surgery - patients with a grade 1 tumour at diagnosis will still be eligible for registration if they have Ki67 >/=8% at surgery (following >/=10 days of pre-surgical AI therapy), as measured at the local site, and meet all other eligibility criteria. \n\n Registration Stage ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Men and pre/perimenopausal women. \n\n Grade 1 tumours* \n\n Intended or actual use of HRT or any other oestrogen-containing medication (including vaginal oestrogens) within 4 weeks prior to planned surgery). Note: patient with a Mirena coil in situ at the time of registration are not excluded. \n\n Patients who commenced pre-surgical AI therapy >6 months prior to surgery. \n\n Prior endocrine therapy for breast cancer or breast cancer prevention. \n\n Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. \n\n Evidence of metastatic disease. \n\n Locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to surgery. \n\n Bilateral invasive breast cancer (excluding contralateral DCIS/LCIS). \n\n Multiple unilateral tumours with different ER and/or HER2 status. Synchronous DCIS/LCIS, as well as multifocal disease with homogenous ER/HER2 status is allowed if at least one lesion is at least 1.5cm; the largest lesion should be used for sample collection and CRF completion. If ER/HER2 status of smaller foci is unknown at time of registration, patients can be registered; however, note that congruity of receptor status will need to be confirmed by the time of randomisation. \n\n Previous invasive breast cancer except for ipsilateral DCIS or LCIS treated >5 years previously by locoregional therapy alone or contralateral DCIS/LCIS treated by locoregional therapy at any time. \n\n Any invasive malignancy diagnosed within previous 5 years (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ). \n\n Any other medical condition likely to exclude the patient from subsequent randomisation stage.

    "brief_summary": "POETIC-A is a phase 3 trial which targets post-menopausal primary breast cancer patients with a high 5-year risk of relapse as determined by a high Ki67 after 2 weeks aromatase inhibitor therapy pre-surgery. Eligible patients will be randomised to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy alone or standard adjuvant endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor called abemaciclib.",
