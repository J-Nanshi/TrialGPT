    "brief_summary": "Pfizer's innovative drug palbociclib (trade name: Ibrance\u00ae) got China National Drug Administration (CNDA) approval on July 31, 2018. Palbociclib combined with an aromatase inhibitor can be used to treat hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer. This brings more treatment options for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced breast cancer. How to scientifically evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of palbociclib combined with an aromatase inhibitor and to establish a more suitable treatment strategy for Chinese patients is one of the questions that need to be answered in clinical practice. This multi-center parallel-group randomized controlled trial will address on this issue.",
