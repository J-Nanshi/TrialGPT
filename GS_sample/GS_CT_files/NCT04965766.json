    "brief_summary": "This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of U3-1402 in participants with advanced breast cancer (ABC) and high expression of human epidermal growth factor Receptor 3 (HER3) defined as 75 percent or more of tumor cell expressing HER3 (seen at 10x objective). Participants have to be hormone-receptor positive (HR+) and have to be resistant to endocrine therapy and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. Participants may have received multiple lines of endocrine therapy with or without targeted therapies and must have received only one line of chemotherapy for ABC.~Moreover, the immune effects, the predictors of resistance and response to treatment, the effect of the chemotherapy on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication will be assessed and will help identify the subgroups that will mostly benefit from the treatment. The pharmacokinetics of the product and the anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be also evaluated.~A total of 100 participants are planned to be included in the study. Participants will receive, every three weeks, a dose of U3-1402 equivalent to 5.6 mg/kg of body weight until progression or until unacceptable toxicity.~Tumor evaluation will be performed every six weeks by the mean of a computed tomography for the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (TAP CT-scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain and/or bone CT scans will be also performed throughout the study for participants with brain and/or bone metastasis.~The safety of the product will be assessed at each cycle, through complete clinical exams, biological tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), cardiac echographies (ECHOs) and through the collection of ongoing toxicities or adverse events.",
