Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception \n\n Patients has adequate hematologic and organ function, defined as: \n\n ANC \u22651500 mm3 without requiring G-CSF \n\n Platelets \u2265100,000/mm3 \n\n Hemoglobin \u22659 g/dL Note: Patients with Hb 7 to \u22649 g/dL (without bleeding) transfused prior to dosing in order to meet eligibility criteria \n\n Serum creatinine \u22641.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference laboratory or creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min within the 28 days before enrollment (calculated from Cockcroft-Gault formula or 24 hour urine collection). \n\n Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) \u22643.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no liver involvement or \u22645\u00d7ULN with liver involvement \n\n Adequate coagulation: prothrombin time (PT), an International Normalized Ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) \u22641.5\u00d7ULN or for patients requiring anticoagulant therapy, the PT/INR, aPTT should be within therapeutic range of the given anticoagulant agent \n\n Total bilirubin \u22641.5\u00d7ULN (or total serum bilirubin \u22643\u00d7ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease) \n\n Patients must be willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific procedure \n\n ",

A wash out of at least 28 days before start of study treatment for radiation of any intended use to the extremities for bone metastases and 28 days for radiation to the chest, brain, or visceral organs is required. Palliative radiation is permissible at any time before or during the study. \n\n Receipt of any live vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study drug and anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab. \n\n Patients considered by Investigators for any other reason to be unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with all study procedures and follow-up examinations.",
