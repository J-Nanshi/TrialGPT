    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply, unless medically indicated and after approval by study chair/IRB office: \n\n Has NSCLC with an oncogenic driver mutation (mutation[s] in EGFR, ERBB2, or BRAF V600E; fusion/rearrangement[s] in ALK, ROS1, NTRK, or RET; or MET amplification).

In cases where brain metastases are superficially located (cortical-based brain metastasis) and leptomeningeal spread is suspected, a work-up for leptomeningeal disease (LMD) should be performed (MRI and lumbar puncture with CSF cytology). If LMD is not confirmed, the treating physician, neuro-oncologist, or brain metastasis multidisciplinary team should make a clinical call and exclude the patient if LMD dissemination is likely. \n\n Has received prior therapy with lenvatinib or other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone or in combination with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD L2, or anti-CTLA-4 agent or chemotherapy is allowed. \n\n Has received prior systemic anticancer therapy including investigational agents within 28 days prior to study treatment initiation. \n\n Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline. Patients with \u2264 Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Patients with immunotherapy-related AEs of a permanent nature but manageable (hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement, vitiligo, etc.) are eligible. \n\n Patients must have recovered adequately from any complications from major surgery. Withhold lenvatinib treatment for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer lenvatinib for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. \n\n Has received radiotherapy within 14 days prior to study treatment initiation. Patients must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. Any radiation to the brain or spinal cord/cauda equina must have been completed within >3 weeks from study treatment initiation. \n\n Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to study treatment initiation. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed. \n\n Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study treatment initiation. \n\n Note: Patients who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 28 days after the last dose of the previous investigational agent. \n\n Contraindications to MRI (implanted metal device or foreign bodies) or MRI contrast (insufficient renal function or allergy). \n\n A WOCBP who has a positive screening serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 (see Appendix 6). \n\n Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to study treatment initiation. \n\n Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 5 years. \n\n Note: Patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded. \n\n Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265 Grade 3) to pembrolizumab or lenvatinib and/or any of their excipients. \n\n Has a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study treatment initiation. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses \u226410 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. \n\n Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease. \n\n Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. \n\n Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus. \n\n Concurrent active Hepatitis B (defined as HBsAg positive and/or detectable HBV DNA) and Hepatitis C virus (defined as anti-HCV Ab positive and detectable HCV RNA) infection. \n\n Note: Hepatitis B and C screening tests are not required unless: \n\n Known history of HBV and HCV infection \n\n As mandated by local health authority \n\n Active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis). \n\n Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. \n\n Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study. \n\n Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment. \n\n GI tract disease causing the inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). \n\n Unable to swallow and retain oral medications. \n\n Has significant cardiac impairment including but not limited to history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association Class II (Appendix 8), unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke within previous 6 months, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at the time of screening. \n\n Has prolongation of QTc using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) to >480 ms. \n\n Has gastric or esophageal varices that may require treatment. \n\n Having a GI bleeding event or active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) with 28 days of enrollment. \n\n Has bleeding or thrombotic disorder(s) or uses anticoagulants such as warfarin or similar agents requiring therapeutic INR monitoring.

    "brief_summary": "This is a single-center, open-label, multi-cohort Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in patients with solid tumors and brain metastases.~The study will be comprised of 3 patient cohorts: triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and solid tumor types other than TNBC and NSCLC. Cohort 3 will be comprised of solid tumor types with established (e.g., renal cell carcinoma [RCC], endometrial cancer) or preliminary clinical evidence (e.g., gastric cancer, colorectal cancer) of efficacy of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and angiogenesis inhibitors. The study will be conducted using a Simon's optimal two-stage design, and approximately 87 patients will be enrolled concurrently (n=29 per cohort).~The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.",
