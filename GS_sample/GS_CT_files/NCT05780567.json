    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel, multi-center trail to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB3616 capsule combined with endocrine compared to placebo compared with endocrine in HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer adjuvant therapy. Approximately 1946 female subjects will be randomized to either TQB3616 combined with endocrine group or TQB3616-matching placebo combined endocrine group. Randomization will follow a 2:1 ratio, 1297 subjects in experimental group and 649 in the the Placebo Comparator group.",
