    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Indication for poly-chemotherapy or single-agent endocrine therapy only or bevacizumab. \n\n Asymptomatic oligometastases of the bone as the only site of metastatic disease. \n\n Uncontrolled/untreated central nervous system lesions. \n\n Patients who received treatment for metastatic/relapsed breast cancer. \n\n Inadequate organ function as per physician's assessment immediate prior to randomization. \n\n Treatment with preparations containing St. John\u00b4s Wort within the last 7 days prior to randomization and/or concurrent use. \n\n Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to compounds or excipients similar to palbociclib, planned chemotherapy or planned endocrine therapy. \n\n Existing contraindication against the use of palbociclib, planned chemotherapy or planned endocrine therapy. \n\n Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, and glucose-galactose malabsorption. \n\n Female patients: pregnancy or lactation at the time of randomization or intention to become pregnant during the study and up to six months after treatment. Male patients: Intention to beget a child during the study and up to six months after treatment.",
    "brief_summary": "The goal of the study for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is to show that palbociclib + endocrine therapy shows a significant improvement in time-to-treatment failure over chemotherapy regimen (mono-chemotherapy with or without endocrine therapy). This would provide level 1 evidence from real world that palbociclib plus endocrine therapy is the first choice in MBC patients needing first-line therapy not only compared to endocrine therapy but also compared to chemotherapy with or without endocrine maintenance therapy.~In addition, we assume that patient-reported outcome as measured by FACT-B and a novel composite endpoint of well-being and healthcare utilization (DMTI) will be improved with palbociclib + endocrine treatment vs. chemotherapy regimen.",
