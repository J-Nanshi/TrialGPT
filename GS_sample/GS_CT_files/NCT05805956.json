If neither is available, the patient may undergo a new tumor biopsy. \n\n According to the evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST v1.1), measurable lesions (longest diameter of spiral CT scan \u2265 10 mm, if the lesion is a lymph node, the short axis \u2265 15 mm; and the lesion has not received radiotherapy, unless the lesion clear progress); Phase I (dose escalation phase): Evaluable lesions (target lesions or non-target lesions); Phase II (Cohort Expansion Phase): Measurable lesions (target lesions) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0 or 1; \n\n Adequate organ and coagulation function \n\n AE related to previous systemic chemotherapy, radical/extensive radiotherapy or other antineoplastic drug treatment recovered to (NCI CTCAE v5.0)\u2264 Grade 1 (except for non-clinically significant or asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities), Patients with controlled grade 2 hypothyroidism and hyperglycemia may be enrolled after consultation with the sponsor; \n\n Cumulative dose of anthracycline doxorubicin \u2264360mg/m2 or its equivalent dose, epirubicin \u2264720mg/m2; \n\n 10. Patients of childbearing age must take effective contraceptive measures during the study to within 6 months after the last dose. \n\n ",
