    "brief_summary": "This study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant docetaxel and epirubicin (DE) with or without human recombinant endostatin (endostar) for breast cancer patients. The hypothesis of this protocol is that a combined angiogenesis inhibiting therapy to chemotherapy could further benefit breast cancer patients.",
