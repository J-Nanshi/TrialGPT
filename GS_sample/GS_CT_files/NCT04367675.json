    "exclusion_criteria": " \n\n Previous treatment with INO-5401 or IL-12 containing therapy, or any other DNA immunotherapy. \n\n Prior history of invasive cancer other than those listed above. History of localized superficial non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma in situ, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or breast ductal carcinoma in situ is allowed. \n\n Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects. \n\n Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 4 weeks prior to study entry and/or during study participation; continued participation in an observational study is allowed. \n\n Cardiac pre-excitation syndromes. \n\n Prior major surgery within 4 weeks of first study treatment. \n\n Presence of acute or chronic bleeding or clotting disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injections or use of blood thinners within 2 weeks of first study treatment. \n\n Any concurrent condition requiring the continued or anticipated use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive therapy. All systemic corticosteroids must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to first study treatment. \n\n History of clinically significant disease or other immunosuppressive disease. \n\n HIV infection. \n\n Known history of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C with active viral replication. \n\n Receipt of any blood product within 2 weeks before signing ICF. \n\n Administration of any vaccine, except influenza vaccine, within 4 weeks of the first study treatment.

    "brief_summary": "The research study is being conducted to test an experimental vaccine to potentially prevent cancer for people with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This study will test if the vaccine is safe (without significant side effects) and test a new way of administering vaccines. It will also test whether the vaccine activates your immune system.",
