    "brief_summary": "This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma; pembrolizumab will be given as monotherapy to participants who have had previous treatment or who are treatment-na\u00efve; pembrolizumab will also be evaluated as combination therapy with cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or (Japan only) capecitabine in treatment-na\u00efve participants. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).",
