    "brief_summary": "This is a study using pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA\u00ae) for first-line treatment of participants with advanced/unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. The primary study objective is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in all participants and by programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.~With Amendment 4, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from this study and will be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.",
