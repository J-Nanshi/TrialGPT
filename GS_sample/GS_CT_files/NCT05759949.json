    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Part 1: Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event (AE) or hypersensitivity reaction with prior PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor treatment. Part 2: Prior treatment with a PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor. \n\n Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes requiring antihyperglycemic medication, or fasting plasma glucose \u2265140 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22657.0%.",
    "brief_summary": "This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RLY-5836 in advanced solid tumors in participants harboring a PIK3CA mutation in blood and/or tumor per local assessment. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expansion (Part 2).",
