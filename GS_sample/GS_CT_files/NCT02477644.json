If the patient is on oral anticoagulants, dose has to be stable for at least two weeks at the time of randomization. \n\n Urine dipstick for proteinuria < 2+. If urine dipstick i s \u22652+, 24-hour urine must demonstrate <1 g of protein in 24 hours. \n\n Normal blood pressure or adequately treated and controlled hypertension (systolic BP \u2264 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \u2264 90 mmHg). \n\n I-9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. I-10. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample from the primary cancer must be available for central BRCA testing and test result must be available for stratification. \n\n I-11. Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of study treatment. (see appendix 4) I-12. For France only: In France, a subject will be eligible for randomization in this study only if either affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category. \n\n ",
