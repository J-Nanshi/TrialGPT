    "brief_summary": "This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study comparing anthracyclines followed by taxane to anthracyclines followed by taxane plus carboplatin as (neo)adjuvant therapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.~Patients with stage II/III operable triple-negative breast cancer are eligible. Patients who need adjuvant chemotherapy after breast surgery as well as patients who need neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC are eligible.",
