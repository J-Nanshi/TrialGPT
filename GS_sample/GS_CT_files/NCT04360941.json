    "exclusion_criteria": " Parts A & B: \n\n Systemic chemotherapy or investigational medicinal products during the previous four weeks, or hormonal therapy within 7 days except luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues for ovarian suppression. Bisphosphonates or RANK ligand antagonists are permitted for the management of bone metastases. \n\n Previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors or immune co-stimulatory drugs. \n\n Previous treatment with palbociclib or any agents which inhibit CDK4/6 \n\n Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks or radiation therapy within 14 days prior to study entry \n\n Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids, untreated brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression. \n\n Active infection requiring systemic therapy \n\n Any of the following within 12 months prior to study entry: myocardial infarction, history of myocarditis, uncontrolled angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack. \n\n Uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac dysrhythmia including atrial fibrillation \n\n Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible. \n\n Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses \u2264 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication). \n\n Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonitis (even if fully resolved), pulmonary fibrosis, end stage renal disease on haemodialysis or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behaviour; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. \n\n Patients on warfarin or direct acting oral anticoagulants. Patients requiring anticoagulation for rate-controlled AF or previous venous thromboembolism should be switched to low-molecular weight heparin. \n\n Known HIV or AIDS-related illness, active infection requiring systemic therapy, or positive HBV or HCV test indicating acute or chronic infection \n\n Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade \u2265 3 NCI CTCAE v 5), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (that is, 3 or more features of partially controlled asthma) \n\n Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills, or receive IV injections. \n\n Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy >Grade 1 (except for stable peripheral neuropathy grade \u22642 or alopecia grade \u22642). \n\n Pregnancy or lactation (women/females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to treatment initiation) \n\n Diagnosis of other malignancy within 3 years, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix, or low-grade (Gleason \u22646) prostate cancer \n\n Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial, whilst taking part in this study. Participation in an observational trial would be acceptable. \n\n Known prior or suspected hypersensitivity to investigational products or to any of the excipients \n\n Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines must also be avoided for 3 months after the last dose of avelumab. \n\n Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent \n\n Requirement for continued use of preparations containing St. John's Wort is specifically contraindicated. Other herbal medicinal or natural products that patient is intended to take during the trial must be explored at the beginning and during the course of the trial and discussed with the investigator. \n\n Requirement for continued use of CYP3A inhibitors, inducers or substrates (listed in Appendix 4). \n\n Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine as this medicinal product contains lactose. \n\n Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial.",
    "brief_summary": "This clinical study is aiming to determine the safest doses and schedule for the combination of two drugs named palbociclib and avelumab.~The study will also be investigating how effective the combination is for a subgroup of breast cancer patients whose cancer expresses the androgen receptor (AR) but not the oestrogen (hormone) or HER2 receptors. Palbociclib is a drug used in routine care for hormone-receptor (HR) positive and HER2 negative advanced breast cancer, the most common subtype of breast cancer.~It is possible that the combination of palbociclib and avelumab will be a more effective cancer treatment than each drug separately, but this is unknown and this study is needed to establish the best dosage and schedule of each drug as well as how effective the combination is.",
