Administration of killed vaccines are allowed. \n\n Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days before the first dose of study medication. \n\n Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years. \n\n Active infection requiring systemic therapy. \n\n Concurrent active hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection. \n\n History of allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant. \n\n Previous treatment with lenvatinib (for participants who will receive lenvatinib in their assigned treatment arm). \n\n Has clinically significant cardiovascular disease within 12 months from first dose of study intervention.",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab/vibostolimab co-formulation (MK-7684A) with or without other anticancer therapies in participants with selected advanced solid tumors. The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab/vibostolimab co-formulation is superior to pembrolizumab alone in terms of objective response rate or progression-free survival in participants with cervical cancer.",
