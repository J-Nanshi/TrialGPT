    "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to learn if giving cemiplimab and vidutolimod together could be effective in treating advanced cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:~How many participants' cancers respond to vidutolimod together with cemiplimab?~Is vidutolimod together with cemiplimab safe and well-tolerated?~How well does vidutolimod together with cemiplimab treat participants' cancer?~Participants will receive trial treatment for up to 2 years. 30 days after stopping treatment, participants will have an end of treatment visit. After that visit, the trial staff will continue to follow up with participants about every 3 months, until the trial ends.",
