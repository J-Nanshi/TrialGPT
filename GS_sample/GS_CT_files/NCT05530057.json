    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Prior treatment with eribulin \n\n Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease \n\n History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF) or systolic dysfunction (LVEF <50%) \n\n High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, high-grade Atrioventricular-block, supraventricular arrhythmias, prolonged QTc(corrected QT interval) which are not adequately rate-controlled) \n\n Angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication \n\n Clinically significant valvular heart disease \n\n Evidence of transmural infarction on ECG \n\n Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic >180mm Hg or diastolic >100mm Hg) \n\n Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential, including women whose last menstrual period was ,12 months ago (unless surgically sterile) who are unable or unwilling to use adequate contraceptive measures during the study treatment period. \n\n Patients who have history of cancer other than in situ uterine cervix cancer or nonmelanotic skin cancer and thyroid cancer. For other types of cancer, patients could be included if there is no evidence of disease for more than 3 years. \n\n Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) \n\n Subjects who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment) \n\n Concurrent disease or serious medical disorder, for example, active or uncontrolled infection, known interstitial lung disease (ILD) or any psychiatric condition prohibiting understanding or rendering of informed consent. \n\n Patients who have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to any of the study agents or their excipients.",
    "brief_summary": "Optimal salvage treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer after trastuzumab and T-DM1 failure still remains to be established. We would like to investigate the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy of eribulin and trastuzumab as salvage treatment for HER2-Positive breast cancer after exposure to trastuzumab and T-DM1",
