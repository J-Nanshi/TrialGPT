    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Prior treatment with any adoptive T-cell therapy or anti-ROR1 therapy \n\n Prior solid organ transplantation \n\n Active, untreated brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease; stable, treated brain involvement by disease is allowed \n\n Untreated or active infection at the time of screening or leukapheresis \n\n HIV-positive, HTLV-1-positive, active acute or chronic HBV or HCV, or active tuberculosis \n\n Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease \n\n Uncontrolled pleural or pericardial effusion \n\n Systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of leukapheresis \n\n Required chronic anticoagulation, such as warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or Factor Xa inhibitors \n\n Pregnant or lactating/nursing women",
    "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of LYL797, a ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell therapy, in patients with ROR1+ relapsed or refractory triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The first part of the study will determine the safe dose for the next part of the study, and will enroll TNBC and NSCLC patients. The second part of the study will test that dose in additional TNBC and NSCLC patients.",
