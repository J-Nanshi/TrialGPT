    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Have received prior treatment with chemotherapy (except for neoadjuvant/ adjuvant chemotherapy), fulvestrant, or any investigational-ER-directed therapy (including SERDs and non-SERDs), any PI3K-, mTOR- or AKT- inhibitor \n\n Have visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread within the lung, or any evidence of leptomeningeal disease. \n\n Have symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis. \n\n Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study \n\n Known allergic reaction against any of the components of the study treatment",
    "brief_summary": "The main purpose of this study is to measure how well imlunestrant works compared to standard hormone therapy, and how well imlunestrant with abemaciclib work compared to imlunestrant in participants with breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Participants must have breast cancer that is advanced or has spread to another part of the body. Study participation could last up to 5 years.",
