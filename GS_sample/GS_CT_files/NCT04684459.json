    "brief_summary": "Serosal cavity metastasis of malignant tumor is one of the late complications, which seriously affects the quality of life and survival time of patients. HER-2 is frequently expressed in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and other malignant tumors. The HER-2/PD-L1 dual-targeting CAR-T will be investigated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumor serosal cavity metastases.",
