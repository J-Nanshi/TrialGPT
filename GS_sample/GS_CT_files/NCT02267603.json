exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy \n\n Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis \n\n Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment \n\n Patient has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-3475 \n\n Patient has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study; the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the protocol principal investigator (PI) and Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN); patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study \n\n Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator \n\n Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial \n\n Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease, non-infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements \n\n Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment \n\n NOTE: pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 \n\n Men and nonpregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly unlikely to conceive is defined as (1) surgically sterilized, or (2) postmenopausal (a woman who is >= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or (3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study;
