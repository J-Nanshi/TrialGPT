    "brief_summary": "This study to learn more about olaparib and olaparib plus durvalumab combination therapy and also to better understand the studied disease, breast cancer, and associated health problems.~Olaparib is a type of drug called a PARP (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor. PARP inhibitors can destroy cancer cells that are not good at repairing DNA damage. Olaparib is also approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in other countries for treating women with BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer.~Durvalumab is a type of anticancer drug called immunotherapy that targets cancer cells by blocking the signal that prevents the immune system from seeing the cancer cell. Your immune system can then attack and kill the cancer cells. Durvalumab is approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after receiving chemoradiation therapy and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.~Some parts of this study are experimental, which means that durvalumab and the combination of olaparib and durvalumab are still in the development stage for the treatment of breast cancer, and they are not approved for treatment of breast cancer, except for use in research studies like this.",
