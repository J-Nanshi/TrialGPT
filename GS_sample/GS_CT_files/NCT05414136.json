    "brief_summary": "Primary objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT1006 in patients with advanced her2-positive solid tumors. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).~Secondary objectives: 1) To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of BAT1006 after single and multiple dosing; 2) To study the immunogenicity of BAT1006; 3) Preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor efficacy of BAT1006.",
