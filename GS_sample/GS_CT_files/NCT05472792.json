If previously on anti-hormonal agents and planning to stop, the subject must discontinue within 30 days of randomization. \n\n Hormonal replacement therapy (eligible if discontinued within 30 days of randomization). \n\n Multifocal or multicentric tumor. \n\n Receipt of tissue rearrangement in the lumpectomy cavity. \n\n Synchronous bilateral breast cancer. \n\n Clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastases. \n\n Prior breast or thoracic radiation. \n\n Autoimmune conditions with associated radiation risks. \n\n Subjects with poor medical risk due to uncontrolled medical conditions that would deem them ineligible for hormonal or radiation therapy.",
    "brief_summary": "The aim of this prospective study is to investigate quality of life and oncologic outcomes in low-risk elderly breast cancer patients randomized to adjuvant therapy with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) alone or endocrine therapy alone after lumpectomy. The study population will include women age 65 years and older with low-risk tumor characteristics (tumor size <2cm, grade 1-2, node-negative). APBI will consist of 5 fractions of radiation therapy delivered every other day to the lumpectomy cavity. Endocrine therapy will be chosen by the treating medical oncologist with an aim of 5 years duration, as tolerated by the patient. Quality of life outcomes will be measured at 1 year following lumpectomy and compared between groups. We hypothesize that the use of APBI may be superior in terms of quality of life when compared to endocrine therapy alone following lumpectomy while providing equivalent rates of disease control and overall survival. In this phase II study, we anticipate enrolling 90 women at N.C. Cancer Hospital in Chapel Hill, NC.",
