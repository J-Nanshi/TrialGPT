(Leukocytes greater than 2000 / mm3, neutrophils greater than 1500 / mm3, hemoglobin greater than 9 g / dl, creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit, transaminases less than 3 times the upper limit, bilirubin less than 1.5 times the upper limit). \n\n Patients of childbearing age and without safe non-hormonal planning methods should have a negative pregnancy test before screening and each treatment cycle. \n\n Fertile female subjects (those who are not postmenopausal for at least 12 months or are surgically sterile by bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) and their male partners, must use at least one of the contraceptive methods that are listed below during study entry, throughout the study, and for at least 6 months after use of the P2Et extract (the effects of the P2Et extract on the developing human fetus are unknown): \n\n to. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse, beginning at least one complete menstrual cycle before administration of study drug; (It should be noted: sexual abstinence as a contraceptive method should be limited to those cases in which it is already established as the choice of the patient's pre-existing lifestyle). \n\n b. Vasectomy in the partner of a female subject c. Intrauterine device (IUD) d. Double barrier method (condom, contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or vaginal ring with jelly or spermicidal cream). \n\n k) Desire to complete the study and follow-up interventions. \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "Currently, the study of many extracts in different types of cancer has allowed the validation of scientific knowledge either as a therapy that reduces the size of the tumor or that helps to improve the quality of life of the patient by reducing the associated effects of the treatment.~In the Immunobiology and Cell Biology group of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, a standardized extract of Caesalpinia spinosa (Dividivi) called P2Et has been obtained. This extract has been shown to have cytotoxic activity in different human and murine tumor cell lines, favoring the induction of immunogenic cell death with the release of danger signals such as calreticulin, HMGB1 and ATP. Additionally, treating mice with murine melanoma and sinus tumors significantly reduces tumor size and metastases. On the other hand, induction of complete autophagic flux and synergistic effects with anthracycline-type chemotherapeutics have been shown in human cell lines and in animal models of breast cancer.~With this background, and the results of the Phase I clinical study carried out in healthy volunteers that showed that the extract is safe, the investigators propose that treatment with the P2Et extract in patients with breast cancer could improve their general condition, impacting their quality of life. , and induce antitumor immune response, improving the immune infiltrate and acting as a transforming agent from a cold tumor to a warm tumor. This would lead to an improvement in the long-term survival of patients treated with the phytomedicine in conjunction with the chemotherapeutic treatment selected by the treating oncologist.~In order to advance on this path, and responding to the adjustments suggested in the phase I study in healthy individuals, it is proposed to carry out a clinical study that allows determining the optimal biological dose of the P2Et extract in a design based on randomized simulations of adaptive form and considering the safety of the extract as an objective in patients with breast cancer. Additionally, those parameters that allow defining the best indicators of effectiveness of P2Et in this group of patients will be evaluated, such as modulation of the immune response, quality of life, reduction of adverse effects and progression-free survival.",
