Confirmed high-grade serous, endometrioid, or carcinosarcoma histotypes are permitted. \n\n Patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer may have received up to 2 prior lines of palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n Patients with brain metastases must have undergone definitive treatment (surgery and/or radiation) at least 1 month prior to starting study drug and be documented as having stable disease by imaging and be on stable doses of steroids for at least 2 weeks. \n\n Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function \n\n Key ",
    "exclusion_criteria": " for dose escalation and comparative PK part: \n\n Significant cardiac disease or abnormality \n\n Patients who have received prior anthracyclines at a cumulative dose that exceeds 250mg/m2 for non-liposomal doxorubicin, 300mg/m2 for liposomal doxorubicin or 400mg/m2 for epirubicin and/or are refractory (during 3 months) to anthracyclines or have experienced allergic reactions or severe toxicity (grade 3 or 4) under anthracyclines \n\n Prior systemic chemotherapy/treatment for adjuvant/metastatic disease, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents within 28 days 5 half- life periods of previous therapy before registration.",
    "brief_summary": "TLD-1 is a novel liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (PEG surface) that compared favorably to conventional liposomal formulations of doxorubicin including Caelyx\u00ae in preclinical in vivo models. Particle features including size, charge distribution, lipid composition and drug release add up to a considerably altered particle behavior compared to Caelyx\u00ae, potentially explaining the lack of hand-foot-syndrome in respective animal models. Preclinical evaluation confirmed TLD-1 to be a promising new and innovative formulation of doxorubicin with promising activity and good tolerability.",
