    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Any approved anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment \n\n Treatment with any other investigational agent or participation in another clinical trial with therapeutic intent within 28 days prior to enrollment \n\n Active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases as determined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during screening and prior radiographic assessments \n\n Leptomeningeal disease \n\n Uncontrolled tumor-related pain \n\n Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently) \n\n Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (greater than [>] 1.5 millimoles per liter [mmol/L] ionized calcium or Ca > 12 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL] or corrected serum calcium > upper limits of normal [ULN]) or symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy or denosumab \n\n Malignancies other than urothelial bladder cancer within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death treated with expected curative outcome or incidental prostate cancer \n\n Pregnant and lactating women \n\n History of autoimmune disease \n\n History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan \n\n Serum albumin less than (<) 2.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) \n\n Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C or tuberculosis \n\n Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 \n\n Significant cardiovascular disease \n\n Major surgical procedure other than for diagnosis within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 \n\n Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplant \n\n Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1 \n\n Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications \n\n Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies, including anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4), anti-programmed death-1 receptor (anti-PD-1), and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapeutic antibodies",
    "brief_summary": "This Phase II, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the effect of atezolizumab treatment in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer. Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 (reported here) will consist of participants who are treatment-na\u00efve and ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Cohort 2 will contain participants who have progressed during or following a prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. The results of the second cohort are reported separately (NCT02108652). Participants in both cohorts will be given a 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) dose of atezolizumab on Day 1 of 21-day cycles. Treatment of participants in Cohort 1 will continue until disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or unmanageable toxicity. Treatment of participants in Cohort 2 will continue until loss of clinical benefit or unmanageable toxicity.",
