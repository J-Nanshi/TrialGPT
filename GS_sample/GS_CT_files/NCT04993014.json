    "brief_summary": "Phase II unicentric randomized trial which will include early HER2 positive breast cancer patients, candidate to neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Circulating tumor cells will be collected at neoadjuvant therapy baseline.~Patients with pathological complete response will be randomized in 1:1 ratio for adjuvant trastuzumab (arm A) versus trastuzumab + pertuzumab (arm B) in a two factorial design: group A, with HER2 positive CTCs and group B, with HER2 negative/absent CTCs.",
