    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, biological therapy or radiotherapy for any reason; \n\n Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or above heart disease (including grade II); \n\n Patients with severe systemic infections or other serious diseases; \n\n Patients with known allergy or intolerance to the study drug or its excipients; \n\n Other malignant tumors in the past 5 years, except cured cervical carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma skin cancer; \n\n Pregnant or lactating patients of childbearing age who refused to take appropriate contraceptive measures during the course of the study; \n\n Participated in other trial studies within 30 days before the administration of the first dose of the study drug; \n\n Patients who were judged by the investigator to be unsuitable for this study.",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to establish a prospective, single-center platform research based on clinical subtypes to explore precision neoadjuvant therapy in patients with operable breast cancer who met the indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and by the update of basic translational research in the center, especially the refinement of typing, the discovery of new targets and the development of novel targeted drugs, verified the effectiveness of new targeted drugs in neoadjuvant therapy.",
