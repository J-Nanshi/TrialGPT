    "brief_summary": "The hypothesis of this study is to discover if the oral Etoposide plus Anlotinib can shrink or slow the growth of pretreated advanced TNBC.~It is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study of oral etoposide combined with antinib in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer",
