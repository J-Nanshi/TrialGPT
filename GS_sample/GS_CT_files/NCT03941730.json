    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well estradiol works in treating patients with estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) positive, triple negative breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Hormone receptors like ER beta allow the body to respond appropriately to hormones. Triple negative means that the breast cancer does not express other hormone receptors called ER alpha, progesterone, and HER2. In some people with triple negative breast cancer, ER beta is overexpressed. Tumor cells that overexpress ER beta grow slower in the laboratory and this growth is slowed in the presence of estrogen. Estradiol is a form of estrogen. This study may help doctors determine whether tumor cells that overexpress ER beta shrink in the presence of estradiol.",
