    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients who meet any of the following are not eligible to enroll in this study: \n\n Active or ongoing eye disorders \n\n Taken any treatments that use the protein folate receptor alpha or FR\u03b1 to work \n\n Taken any other experimental treatments \n\n History of significant cardiac issues or other cancers within 3 years. \n\n Significant anemia, significant neutropenia, or significant thrombocytopenia (e.g., not enough platelets in your blood - platelets held stop bleeding in your body) \n\n Detectable viral load for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis B or C. \n\n If you are pregnant. \n\n Part 1: Cannot have active autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, MS (multiple sclerosis), ankylosing spondylitis, thyroiditis that require treatments that suppress your immune system. \n\n Part 1: if your cancer has spread to your brain. \n\n Part 2: You can have cancer that has spread to your brain but there are exceptions. The cancer in your brain cannot be causing any symptoms, it cannot be larger than 3 cm, there can be no evidence on a scan that shows your brain tissue has shifted from its expected position inside the skull (called herniation) or be bleeding in the skull or brain itself (called hemorrhage).",
    "brief_summary": "This study, ELU- FR\u03b1-1, is focused on adult subjects who have advanced, recurrent or refractory folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) overexpressing tumors considered to be topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-sensitive based on scientific literature, and, in the opinion of the Investigator, have no other meaningful life-prolonging therapy options available.~ELU001 is a new chemical entity described as a C'Dot drug conjugate (CDC), consisting of payloads (exatecans) and targeting moieties (folic acid analogs) covalently bound by linkers to the C'Dot particle carrier. ELU001 will be the first drug-conjugate of its kind to be introduced into the clinic, a first in class, and a novel molecular entity.",
