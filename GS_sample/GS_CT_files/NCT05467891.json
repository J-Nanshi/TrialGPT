Radiation therapy is mandated for patients with microscopically involved margins and recommended for all patients who had not received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment. \n\n Patients who have distant metastatic disease will not be eligible. \n\n Prior treatment with neo- adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and ET is allowed. \n\n Patients must enroll within 6 months of the last local treatment, surgery or radiation, whichever occurred last. \n\n Patient has no contraindication for the adjuvant ET in the trial and is planned to be treated with ET. Subjects who have already started adjuvant ET within 3 months prior to registration are allowed. \n\n Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below; all screening labs to be obtained within 28 days prior to registration. \n\n Hematological \n\n Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): \u2265 1.5 x 109/L \n\n Platelets: \u2265 100 x 109/L \n\n Hemoglobin (Hgb): \u2265 9.0 g/dL \n\n Renal \n\n ---Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): \u2265 30 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula \n\n Hepatic \n\n Bilirubin: < upper limit of normal (ULN) except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may only be included if the total bilirubin is \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \n\n Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN except for patients with liver metastasis, who are only included if the AST is < 5 \u00d7 ULN \n\n Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN except for patients with liver metastasis, who are only included if the ALT is < 5 \u00d7 ULN \n\n Coagulation \n\n ---International Normalized Ratio (INR) : \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN (unless is receiving anticoagulants and the INR is within the therapeutic range of intended use for that anticoagulant within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug) \n\n Electrolytes ---Potassium, Magnesium, and Total Calcium (corrected for serum albumin): Within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with supplements. \n\n Standard 12-lead ECG values defined as \n\n QTcF interval at screening < 450 msec (QT interval using Fridericia's correction) \n\n Resting heart rate 50-90 bpm (determined from the ECG) \n\n Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a male able to father a child must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to registration and must be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception that does not contain estrogen and/or progesterone.

Patients who received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the adjuvant setting may participate if they have been off therapy for at least 1 year prior to diagnosis of recurrent disease. \n\n Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects. \n\n Pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the trial (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being treated on study). \n\n Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are not eligible for this trial. \n\n Patients with distant metastases of breast cancer beyond regional lymph nodes as defined by AJCC (8th edition). \n\n Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration or participation in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.
