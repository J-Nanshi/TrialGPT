However, patients with any grade of alopecia were allowed ; \n\n Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may be enrolled, if: \n\n Intracranial lesions are evaluable and eligible for systemic therapy only in the absence of extracranial evaluable lesions, or \n\n Patients with stable intracranial lesions after local treatment while there are extracranial evaluable lesions ; \n\n Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function; \n\n Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a contraceptive method during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of experiment treatment; \n\n Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; \n\n Patients must be able to participate and comply with treatment and follow up. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n HER-2 positive (IHC 3+, or FISH positive); \n\n Other malignancies (including primary brain or leptomeninges-related tumors) within the past 5 years, except cured cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ; \n\n Patients who have received anti-tumor therapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment, including chemotherapy, radical radiotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy or anti-tumor Chinese medicine therapy; \n\n Patients who have undergone major organ surgery (excluding needle biopsy) or have significant trauma within 4 weeks before the first dose of treatment, or anticipating for a major surgical procedure during the study; \n\n Experienced grade \u2265 3 nervous system-related adverse events after treatment with anti-microtubule drugs; \n\n Symptomatic central nervous system metastases; \n\n Pregnant or lactating women; \n\n Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or excipients; \n\n Any other non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that precludes study treatment implementation or follow-up ; \n\n Any other condition that the investigator considers inappropriate to participate in this trial . \n\n Use of corticosteroids is prohibited.",
