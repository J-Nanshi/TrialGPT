    "brief_summary": "The objective of this study is to compare the curative effects in patients under the age of 35 with hormone receptor positive breast cancer and high recurrent risk factors including large tumor or metastatic lymph nodes randomized to ovarian function suppression (OFS) plus aromatase inhibitors or OFS plus tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy, and explore the differences of curative effects between different subtypes to provide direct evidence for treatments of young breast cancer patients.",
