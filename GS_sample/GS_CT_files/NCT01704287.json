    "brief_summary": "This study was conducted to compare survival using pembrolizumab (SCH 900475, MK-3475) or standard chemotherapy in participants with advanced melanoma (MEL) who had progressed after prior therapy.~Initial Treatment Period:~Participants were initially randomized to receive either low-dose (2 mg/kg) pembrolizumab, higher dose (10 mg/kg) pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy (ICC). The four standard chemotherapy choices were: carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or temozolomide. The randomization to either pembrolizumab or ICC was conducted in an open-label fashion.~The starting pembrolizumab dose was initially blinded to Investigators and participants until Amendment 03. With Amendment 03, all ongoing pembrolizumab participants were to be treated with open label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg, instead of a weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.~Switch-to-Pembrolizumab Treatment Period:~Participants who were initially randomized to receive ICC and experienced progressive disease (PD) may have been eligible to switch to receiving pembrolizumab provided they met protocol-specified requirements for switching. Qualified participants were re-randomized to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg in a double-blind fashion. Participants who qualified to switch to pembrolizumab must have completed a washout period of \u226528 days from last dose of chemotherapy before receiving pembrolizumab. With Amendment 03, all switched-to-pembrolizumab participants were to be treated with open-label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg instead of a weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.",
