    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Presence of third interstitial fluid that cannot be controlled by drainage or other methods, such as massive pleural and ascites fluid. \n\n the presence of multiple factors that interfere with oral administration and absorption of the drug (e.g., inability to swallow, post-gastrectomy, chronic diarrhea, and intestinal obstruction). \n\n have a proven allergy to the drug components of this regimen. \n\n Patients who are known to be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or patients of gestational age who are unwilling to use effective contraception throughout the trial period. \n\n Patients with severe concomitant disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not suitable for inclusion. \n\n Patients with the presence of meningeal metastases. \n\n having participated in a clinical trial of another drug within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. \n\n Patients who have used capecitabine during the neoadjuvant/adjuvant phase of therapy are allowed to be enrolled, but those who are ineffective or cannot tolerate capecitabine during the neoadjuvant/adjuvant phase of therapy need to be excluded; patients who have used capecitabine for \u2264 3 months after brain metastasis and whose disease has not progressed can be enrolled; other drugs for which the active ingredient is 5-fluorouracil are treated as capecitabine (Note:  used capecitabine refers to continuous standardized use of capecitabine for \u2265 2 cycles). \n\n Concurrently receiving other antitumor therapy.",
