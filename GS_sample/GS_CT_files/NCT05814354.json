    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable. \n\n A history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is known, or has an active autoimmune disease. \n\n History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonia requiring oral or intravenous steroids. \n\n Has moderate or severe cardiovascular disease. \n\n Active HBV(hepatitis B) or HCV (Hepatitis C virus)-infected subjects. \n\n Any other malignancies within 5 years except for those with negligible risk of metastasis or death.",
    "brief_summary": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the progression-free survival of SHR-A1811 was superior to investigator-selected chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.
