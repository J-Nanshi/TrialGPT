    "brief_summary": "This is an open-label randomized phase II study in estrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients. The main inclusion population are either luminal subtype B by PAM50 analysis or failed less than 2 lines of hormonal therapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The subjects have to be premenopausal or perimenopausal and are not allowed to receive any systemic chemotherapy for their locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Eligible subjects will be randomized into goserelin/ fulvestrant (Arm 1, control), goserelin/ fulvestrant/ capivasertib (Arm 2), goserelin/ fulvestrant/ capivasertib/ durvalumab (Arm 3), or goserelin/ fulvestrant/ durvalumab (Arm 4) at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) of the whole other three arm compared to goserelin/ fulvestrant control arm. The major secondary endpoint will be progression-free survival or ORR compared among different treatment arms.",
