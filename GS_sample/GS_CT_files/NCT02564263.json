    "brief_summary": "In this study, participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) that had progressed after first-line standard therapy were randomized to receive either pembrolizumab (MK-3475) OR the Investigator's choice of standard chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan.~The primary study hypothesis was that treatment with pembrolizumab would prolong overall survival (OS) as compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy.",
