    "brief_summary": "This is a single center, single arm, open and exploratory clinical study, with 50 cases planned for a period of 2 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of Patient-Derived Organoid Model of breast cancer to predict the clinical efficacy of the drug, as well as the possibility of guiding the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
