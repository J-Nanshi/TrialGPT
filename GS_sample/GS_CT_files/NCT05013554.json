    "brief_summary": "Primary Objectives:~Part 1 (Dose Escalation)~To determine the MTD/maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR443216 administered as a single agent in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors and determine the RP2D for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration in the dose escalation part.~To determine the safety of SAR443216 after intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration.~Part 2 (Dose expansion)~\u2022 To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR4443216 at the RP2D in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.~Secondary Objectives:~Part 1 \u2022 To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 after IV and SC administration at the R2PD in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.~Part 2~\u2022 To determine the safety of SAR443216.~Part 1 and 2~To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR443216 when administered as a single agent after IV and SC (Part 1 only) administration.~To evaluate the immunogenicity of SAR443216 after IV and SC administration.~To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 at the R2PD in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.",
