    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patient previously had known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to the excipients \n\n Part A: Treatment with any PD-1, or Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein (CTLA)-4 directed antibody, or with any other immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation of the study drug. \n\n Part A: Use of other biological investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication), including use of investigational drugs targeting CD137/4-1BB within at least 5 half-lives (or within 8 weeks, whatever is longer) prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug. \n\n Part B: As defined per protocol for each expansion cohort, has not been treated with specified first/second-line standard-of-care therapies biological drugs (marketed or investigational) for treatment of the current cancer, or has not adequately recovered from AEs that occurred with prior therapy. \n\n Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease.",
    "brief_summary": "This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2, dose-escalation study with expansion cohorts to evaluate NM21-1480 for safety and immunogenicity, to determine the maximal tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose, define the pharmacokinetics, to explore the pharmacodynamics, and to obtain preliminary evidence of the clinical activity in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors.",
