    "brief_summary": "This study evaluates the Impact of DihydroPyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) activity on the efficacy of Capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The DPD phenotype before the initiation of treatment will be assess and then the patient will be follow up during the treatment with Capecitabine up to 24 month.",
