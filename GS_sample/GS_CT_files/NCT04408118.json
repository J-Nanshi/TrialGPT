Triple-negative is defined as <1% expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and negative for HER2 (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC] or 2+ and negative by in situ hybridization [ISH] test). \n\n Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to resection with curative intent. \n\n No prior chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy and/or antiangiogenic agent for MBC. Patients who have received (neo)adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and/or an antiangiogenic agent are required to have a disease-free interval (DFI) of at least 12 months after completion of each of these treatments. For (neo)adjuvant non-taxane-based chemotherapy, a DFI of at least 6 months is required. \n\n Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade \u2264 1 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia, grade \u2264 2 peripheral neuropathy, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion). \n\n Evidence of measurable disease or non-measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients with only bone lesions are also eligible. \n\n Willingness and ability to provide the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression from either metastatic or primary tissues at the time of the inclusion to perform exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's qualified designee. An additional tumor biopsy from either metastatic or primary (only if metastatic biopsies cannot be obtained for inaccessible lesion or subject safety concern) tissues would be collected at disease progression or study termination whenever it is feasible. \n\n Note: Patients for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or safety concern) may submit archived pathological material from either metastatic or primary sites, but the most recent tumor biopsy from the patient should be obtained when available. \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. \n\n Life expectancy of \u226512 weeks. \n\n Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days before the first study treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), defined by the following parameters: \n\n Hematological: White blood cell (WBC) count > 3.0 x 109/L; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5 X 109/L (without granulocyte colony- stimulating factor [G-CSF] support within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day1); Lymphocyte count 3 0.5 x 109/L (500\u03bcL); Platelet count 3 75.0 x 109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1); Hemoglobin > 9.0 g/dL (Patients may be transfused or receive erythropoietic treatment to meet this criterion). \n\n Note: Patients cannot be transfused platelets within 14 days prior to C1D1 to meet this criterion.

Current treatment with anti-viral therapy for HBV is not allowed. \n\n Note: HBV DNA test only to be performed for patients with a positive total HBcAb test. \n\n Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. \n\n Note: HCV RNA test only to be performed for patients with a positive HCV antibody test. \n\n Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days before study treatment initiation and agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use one highly effective contraceptive method, or two effective contraceptive methods, as defined in the protocol during the treatment period for at least 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, and for at least 6 months after the last dose of paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae). \n\n ",
