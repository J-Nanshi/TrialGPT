    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or surgery (outpatient clinic surgery excluded)within3 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment(bisphosphonates can be used for bone metastasis); \n\n Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing CNS metastases(glucocorticoids or mannitol needed to control symptoms); \n\n Significant cardiovascular disease(including congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia in the last 6 months); \n\n Grade \u2265 1 adverse reactions that are ongoing due to previous treatment. Exceptions to this are hair loss or the investigator's opinion should not be ruled out. Such cases should be clearly documented in the investigator's notes; \n\n Is pregnant or breast feeding; \n\n Malignant tumors in the past five years (except cured skin basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ).",
