    "brief_summary": "The current standard of care for stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer is adjuvant chemotherapy combined with 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer has the advantages of i) tumour downsizing, ii) higher breast conservation rates, and iii) enabling the evaluation of tumour biology. Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent, strong predictor of outcome in operable HER2-positive breast cancer. The addition of neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable HER2-positive breast cancer. However, the optimal neoadjuvant regimen has not been defined in HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators recently completed a phase II study of neoadjuvant lapatinib combined with weekly paclitaxel/ carboplatin in stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Preliminary analysis suggested that the utility of the regimen might have been limited by its unfavourable efficacy/ toxicity ratio. ASLAN001 is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1, HER2, and HER4. Preclinical data have shown ASLAN001 to be more potent than lapatinib and neratinib in inhibiting HER1 and HER2, and early phase clinical studies have demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic target inhibition compared to lapatinib. Furthermore, ASLAN001 has demonstrated a better safety profile than lapatinib in early phase studies.~\u2022 The investigators hypothesize that ASLAN001 combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin will induce favorable pathological complete response (of at least 30%) in stage I-III HER2 positive breast cancer, with a more favourable safety profile than lapatinib combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin.",
