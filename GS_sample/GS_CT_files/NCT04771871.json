    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. \n\n Patients with distant metastasis (brain and/or visceral metastasis) \n\n Serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s). \n\n Treatment for other carcinomas within the last 5 years, except non-melanoma skin cancer and treated cervical carcinoma in-situ (CCIS) \n\n Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of study treatment \n\n Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might compromise study participation including but not limited to chronic or active infection, HIV-positive patient, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.",
    "brief_summary": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with higher proportion of Blacks affected and in younger age groups. There is no targeted therapy unlike other types of breast cancer such as hormone positive and Human Epidermal Growth factor 2 (HER2) positive subtypes. Chemotherapy is therefore the main choice of systemic treatment with rapid development of resistance in most cases. At present, there is no blood test to monitor treatment response and disease relapse. This one-stage phase II study with a single arm design will determine the response rate of standard chemotherapy using Epirubicin (60mg/m2), Cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) , Paclitaxel (120mg/m2) and Carboplatin (6AUC) in TNBC patients. We will measure the blood level of microRNA molecules and circulating tumor DNA during and after treatment to test if changes can be used to indicate drug failure in these patients. Disease status and tumor response will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines while toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE v5). The trial will be conducted as per the International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) Guidelines E6 (R1) and other applicable guidelines",
