    "brief_summary": "90 patients with HER2 negative breast cancer will be randomised to receive 18 weeks of chemotherapy treatment, either 6 cycles of 3 weekly Cabazitaxel or 6 cycles of weekly Paclitaxel to determine the difference in progression free survival between the 2 groups. If results at that stage suggest a potential benefit then the trial will be developed further to accrue 70 more patients.",
