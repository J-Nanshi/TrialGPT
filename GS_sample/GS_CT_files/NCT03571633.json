    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients with inflammatory breast cancer. \n\n Previous exposure to pegfilgrastim or trastuzumab. Note: the use of filgrastim (non pegylated form only) is authorized prior to the randomisation. \n\n Patients requiring the concomitant use of any forbidden treatment including: Any other anti-cancer treatments not listed in the protocol, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or biologic therapy for cancer treatment, Any investigational treatment. \n\n Any contra-indication to trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and pegfilgrastim respective SPCs including:Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in trastuzumab SPC, Severe dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy, Hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim, or to any of the excipients listed in SPC, Hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, Hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or to any excipient, particularly macrogolglycerol ricinoleate, Patients with history of or active cardiac disease including myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, congestive heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class \u2265II, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, and hemodynamic effective pericardial effusion. \n\n Active secondary malignancy unless this malignancy is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of study endpoints and is approved by the sponsor. Examples of the latter include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix. Patients with a completely treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for \u2265 2 years are eligible. \n\n Pregnant or breast-feeding female patients.",
    "brief_summary": "First preclinical data suggest that pegfilgrastim could constitute a potent adjuvant for immunotherapy with mAb possessing ADCC/ADCP properties as trastuzumab. Combined treatment of pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab should translate into an increased rate of pathological clinical response. Therefore the investigators' proposal is to evaluate the clinical and biological impact of pegfilgrastim in combination with trastuzumab + paclitaxel in HER2-positive early stage breast cancer patients. Breastimmune02 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase II trial. Operable HER2+ breast cancer patients previously treated with 4 cycles of standard adriamycine/cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy will be randomized (1:1) to receive in the neoadjuvant setting:Arm A: weekly paclitaxel + trastuzumab (every 3 weeks, Q3W) + pegfilgrastim (Q3W) versus Arm B: weekly paclitaxel + trastuzumab (Q3W).Stratification criteria will be: cN0 versus cN1.",
