    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients must meet the following criteria in order to be included in the research study: \n\n Written informed consent, according to local guidelines, signed and dated by the patient or by a legal guardian prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures, sampling, or analyses \n\n Women and men at least 18 years-of-age at the time of signature of the informed consent form (ICF) \n\n Histologically documented locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer \n\n Triple-negative breast cancer patients should have received at least 1 but no more than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting \n\n Parts A and B (HER2-negative, ER-positive) patients only: HR+ breast cancer patients should have received prior treatment with endocrine therapy +CDK 4/6 inhibitor. No limit to prior endocrine therapy regimens but no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting \n\n Part Z patients only should have documented HER2-positive expression as per American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists guidelines based on local testing. \n\n Part Z patients only should have had prior treatment with at least 2 anti-HER2 therapies, 1 of which must be T-DXd. These patients must have experienced disease progression after receiving T-DXd. \n\n Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (bone-only disease excluded) \n\n Patients who have received radiation or surgery for brain metastases are eligible if therapy was completed \u22654 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment (2 weeks for patients who received palliative radiation therapy), there is no evidence of central nervous system disease progression on a scan or mild neurologic symptoms, and there is no requirement for chronic corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of brain metastases \n\n Willingness to undergo pre-treatment biopsy and on-treatment biopsies. Must have a tumor amenable to pre-treatment biopsy (unless archived tissue is available and was obtained within 2 months prior to starting treatment) and on-treatment biopsy (excludes bone lesions and previously irradiated lesions). \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1 \n\n Has adequate organ function within 7 days before the start of study treatment, defined as: \n\n Platelet count \u2265100 \u00d7 10^9/L \n\n Hemoglobin (Hb) \u22659 g/dL (transfusion and/or growth factor support allowed) \n\n Absolute neutrophil count \u22651.5 \u00d7 10^9/L \n\n Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \u22641.5 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN), except for patients on coumadin-derivative anticoagulants or other similar anticoagulant therapy, who must have PT-international normalized ratio (INR) within therapeutic range as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. \n\n Serum creatinine \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN, or creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min as calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation; confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is >1.5 \u00d7 ULN. \n\n AST/ALT \u22643 \u00d7 ULN (if liver metastases are present, \u22645 \u00d7 ULN) \n\n Total bilirubin \u22641.5 \u00d7 ULN if no liver metastases or < 3 \u00d7 ULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's syndrome or liver metastases \n\n Serum albumin \u2265 2.5 g/dL \n\n Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential and female patients of childbearing potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during their participation in the study and for at least 7 months following last dose. Male patients must also refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study. \n\n ",
