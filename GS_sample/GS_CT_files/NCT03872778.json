If the only matching lesion is located in the bone, the patient will still be eligible. \n\n Patients for whom no standard therapy is available, tolerated or appropriate in both Phase I and Phase IIa. Specifically in the Phase IIa breast cancer cohort, patients need to have completed at least two prior treatments of endocrine therapy (including CDk4/6i) and at least one prior chemotherapy (unless contraindicated) in the metastatic setting. \n\n Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2. \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this first-in-human (FIH) study of [177Lu]-NeoB is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) as well as the distribution and radiation dosimetry, and anti-tumor activity of [177Lu]-NeoB in patients with advanced solid tumors known to overexpress GRPR and with [68Ga]-NeoB lesion uptake.",
