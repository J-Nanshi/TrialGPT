    "brief_summary": "TAC01-HER2 is a novel cell therapy that consists of genetically engineered autologous T cells expressing T-cell Antigen Coupler (TAC) that recognizes human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TAC directs T-cells to the targeted antigen (HER2), and once engaged with the target, activates them via the endogenous T cell receptor.~This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study that aims to establish safety, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of TAC01-HER2 in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.",
