    "brief_summary": "This study is being done to investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Cohort A), advanced head and neck cancer (Cohorts B and B2), advanced urothelial cancer (Cohort C), or advanced gastric cancer (Cohort D). Additionally, for Cohort D, data is presented for Asian Pacific (AP) participants. Only participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing tumors were enrolled in Cohorts A, B, C and D. Participants in Cohort B2 were enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status.~The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is safe and well-tolerated.",
