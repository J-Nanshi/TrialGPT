    "brief_summary": "This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA\u00ae) as monotherapy in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts: participants with advanced HCC and with no curative option after disease progression on sorafenib or intolerance of sorafenib (Cohort 1) or who had not received treatment for systemic disease (Cohort 2). Study participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 initial cycles (up to approximately 2 years) and a potential additional 17 cycles in a re-treatment phase (approximately an additional 1 year of treatment) .~The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with HCC.~Effective with Amendment 7: Upon study completion, participants are discontinued and may be enrolled in a pembrolizumab extension study, if available.",
