    "brief_summary": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for approximately 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. Of these women, 20% require radical management in the form of mastectomy because of the extent of the lesions, which most often manifest as diffuse microcalcifications.~This mutilating surgical management contrasts with the excellent prognosis of this pathology and considerably alters the quality of life of patients.~Neoadjuvant hormone therapy has shown its efficacy in hormone-dependent infiltrating ductal carcinomas and offers the possibility of conservative surgery after hormone therapy.~Adjuvant hormone therapy with Tamoxifen or anti-aromatase drugs has shown its efficacy in the prevention of homo or contralateral recurrence.~The HORNEO 01 trial fits perfectly in the current context of surgical de-escalation of ductal carcinomas in situ. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant hormone therapy on the surgical management of extensive DCIS.",
