    "brief_summary": "NUV-868-01 is a first-in-human, open-label, Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 and 1b portions include patients with advanced solid tumors and are designed to determine the safety and the dose of NUV-868 to be used as monotherapy and in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide for the Phase 2 and 2b portions. In these Phase 2 portions, NUV-868 as a monotherapy (Phase 2) or in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide (Phase 2b) will be given to determine the safety and efficacy of these study treatments. Patients will self-administer NUV-868 orally daily in 28-day cycles as monotherapy in Phases 1 and 2. In Phases 1b and 2b, patients will self-administer NUV-868 orally daily in 28-day cycles with either 300 mg olaparib twice daily or 160 mg enzalutamide daily. Patients will be treated until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.",
