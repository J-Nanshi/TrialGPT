There is no required minimum washout period for radiation therapy; however, patients should have recovered from the effects of radiation prior to registration. \n\n Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1 Note: previously irradiated lesions may be considered as measurable disease only if disease progression has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation. \n\n Availability of a representative FFPE tumour block (preferred) or at least 25 unstained slides collected within 12 months prior to registration Note: An FFPE block/slides will not be required for cases where tumour tissue was previously sent to the Central Laboratory for PD-L1 status testing in pre-screening following discussion with the CPI. \n\n Note: If a tumour sample taken within 12 months before registration is not available and a tumour biopsy is not clinically feasible, the primary surgical resection sample or the most recent FFPE tumour biopsy sample may be used. \n\n Note: Patients with fewer than 25 unstained slides (but no fewer than 17) may be eligible following discussion with the CPI. \n\n Patients with an ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix 1) \n\n Life expectancy \u2265 12 weeks \n\n Adequate haematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 7 days prior to registration: \n\n ANC \u2265 1.5x109/L (without G-CSF support within 2 weeks prior to registration) Lymphocyte count \u2265 0.5x109/L Platelet count \u2265 100x109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to registration) Haemoglobin \u2265 80 g/L (patients may be transfused or receive erythropoietic treatment to meet this criterion) \n\n AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 x the ULN, with the following exceptions: \n\n Patients with documented liver metastases: AST and ALT \u2264 5\u00d7 ULN Serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5\u00d7 ULN \n\n Patients with known Gilbert's disease who have serum bilirubin level \u2264 3\u00d7 ULN may be enrolled. \n\n Patients who are not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR and aPTT \u2264 1.5\u00d7 ULN. Patients who are receiving an anticoagulant medicinal product must be on a stable anticoagulant regimen and have an INR which is not above the target therapeutic range during the 7 days prior to registration Calculated CrCl \u2265 30 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula; see Appendix 2). \n\n Women of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of \u22641% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment (see section 7.11.1.1) \n\n Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration to the study \n\n Men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm as defined in section 7.11.1.2 \n\n Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing biopsies, treatment, and scheduled visits and examination including follow up \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry: \n\n Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease has been clinically stable for > 2 weeks prior to registration to study \n\n Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing CNS metastases. Patients with a history of treated CNS lesions are eligible, provided that all of the following criteria are met: \n\n Measurable or non-measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1, must be present outside the CNS No history of intracranial haemorrhage or spinal cord haemorrhage Metastases are limited to the cerebellum or the supratentorial region (i.e., no metastases to the midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord) There is no clinical or radiological evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening brain scan The patient has not received stereotactic radiotherapy within 7 days prior to registration to the study or whole-brain radiotherapy within 14 days prior to registration to the study The patient has no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease. Anticonvulsant therapy at a stable dose is permitted Asymptomatic patients with CNS metastases newly detected at screening are eligible for the study after receiving radiotherapy or surgery, with no need to repeat the screening brain scan \n\n Grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy \n\n History or presence of leptomeningeal disease \n\n Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring recurrent drainage procedures (once monthly or more frequently) (patients with indwelling catheters such as PleurX\u00ae are allowed) \n\n Uncontrolled tumour-related pain Note: Patients requiring pain medication must be on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g. bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to registration to the study. Patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation prior to registration. There is no required minimum recovery period. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g. epidural metastasis that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy, if appropriate, prior to registration to the study. \n\n Uncontrolled or symptomatic hypercalcemia (> 1.5 mmol/L ionised calcium or total calcium >3 mmol/L or corrected serum calcium > ULN) or symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy Note: Patients who are receiving bisphosphonate therapy specifically to prevent skeletal events and who do not have a history of clinically significant hypercalcaemia are eligible \n\n Malignancies other than TNBC within 5 years prior to registration to the study, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS rate \u2265 90%) and treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma, localised prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer) \n\n Significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac disease (Class II or greater), myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to registration, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina Note: Patients with a known LVEF < 40% will be excluded Note: Patients with known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above criteria, or LVEF 40-50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimised in the opinion of the treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate \n\n Presence of an abnormal ECG that is clinically significant in the Investigator's opinion, including complete left bundle branch block, second or third-degree heart block, evidence of prior myocardial infarction, or QTcF > 470 ms demonstrated by at least two consecutive ECGs \n\n Severe infection requiring oral or IV antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to registration to the study, including but not limited to hospitalisation for complications of infection, bacteraemia, or severe pneumonia Note: patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., to prevent a urinary tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) are eligible for the study \n\n Positive HIV test at screening \n\n Patients with active hepatitis B (chronic or acute; defined as having a positive HBsAg test at screening) or hepatitis C Note: Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of HBc Ab and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in these patients prior to registration Note: Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for HCV RNA \n\n Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to registration to the study or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis Note: placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g. port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted \n\n Treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to registration \n\n Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during or within 6 months after the last dose of study treatment \n\n Any other significant uncontrolled disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications. This includes significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, or superior vena cava syndrome) \n\n Poor peripheral venous access \n\n Known sensitivity to any component of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin and/or gemcitabine ",
    "brief_summary": "The study hypothesise that the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab and atezolizumab may be synergistic and improve outcomes for patients with early relapsed TNBC by overcoming mechanisms of immune resistance and thus potentiating greater and more durable responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Early relapsing TNBC represents a high priority, unmet need whereby effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.",
