    "brief_summary": "This study will test the safety, including side effects, and determine the characteristics of a drug called PRO1184 in participants with solid tumors.~Participants will have solid tumor cancer that has spread through the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable).~This study will have two parts. Part A of the study will find out how much and how frequently PRO1184 should be given to participants. Part B will use the dose and schedule found in Part A to find out how safe PRO1184 is and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.",
