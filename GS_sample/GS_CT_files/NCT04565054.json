Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer defined as \n\n a negative in-situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+, or 2+, \n\n if IHC is 2+, a negative in-situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or SISH) test is required (based on the analyzed tissue sample at initial diagnosis by a local laboratory). \n\n 7. Completed local therapy of breast cancer according to current guidelines. 8. Completed or ongoing endocrine therapy for 2-6 years after primary diagnosis without any signs of distant or local relapse as well secondary malignancy. \n\n 9a.

Known high genomic risk, defined as either one of the following criteria: \n\n c/pN 1 with RS (Oncotype Dx\u00ae) >18, \n\n c/pN 0 with RS >25, \n\n high risk by PROSIGNA\u00ae (score > 60 in N 0 and >40 in N+) or EPclin\u00ae (Score >3.3287), or MammaPrint\u00ae within clinical routine; OR \n\n In case the tumor is of intermediate clinical risk, but genomic risk is not known at registration: \n\n 9c. Intermediate clinical and unknown genomic risk c/pN 0-1 in luminal-B-like tumor (G3 and/or Ki-67 pre-treatment \u2265 20%), AND \n\n RS >18 (Oncotype Dx\u00ae in screening phase) in patients with c/pN 1, or \n\n RS >25 (Oncotype Dx\u00ae in screening phase) in patients with c/pN 0. \n\n B. Prior to RANDOMIZATION in the study 10. No clinical evidence of distant metastasis (confirmation recommended prior to randomization by CT thorax / abdomen, chest X-ray, liver ultrasound, bone scan, or PET-CT, respectively). \n\n 11. Patient has available tumor tissue from primary diagnostic biopsy. 12. No contraindication for adjuvant ET. 13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. 14. Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following laboratory values: \n\n absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L (without administration of any growth stimulation factors within 30 days prior to inclusion), \n\n platelets \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L, \n\n hemoglobin \u2265 8.0 g/dL (without any RBC transfusion within 30 days prior to inclusion), \n\n total bilirubin <1.5 ULN, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who may only be included if the total bilirubin is \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN or direct bilirubin within normal ranges, \n\n aspartate transaminase (AST) < 3 \u00d7 ULN, \n\n alanine transaminase (ALT) < 3 \u00d7 ULN, \n\n serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN. 15. Ability to swallow abemaciclib tablets or to administer other study medication, respectively. \n\n 16. Ability to communicate with the investigator and comply with study procedures. \n\n 17. Willing to receive therapy by the clinical site, as required by the protocol. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients eligible for inclusion in this study must not meet any of the following criteria: \n\n Patient with distant metastases of breast cancer beyond regional lymph nodes. \n\n Previously received CDK 4/6 inhibitor. \n\n Patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of abemaciclib or standard-of-care endocrine therapy. \n\n Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects. \n\n Patient has not recovered from clinical and laboratory acute toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to NCI CTCAE version 5.0 Grade \u2264 1 (polyneuropathy \u2264 2 is allowed). \n\n Patient has a concurrent malignancy or non-breast malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization. \n\n Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., uncontrolled ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small-bowel resection). \n\n Patient has any active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]. Screening is not required for enrollment. \n\n Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator\u00b4s judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance <30ml/min], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, etc.). \n\n Patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. \n\n Patient is currently receiving any of the following substances, which cannot be discontinued 7 days prior to day 1 of study treatment: \n\n o concomitant medications and herbal supplements, that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4. \n\n Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment. \n\n Not able to understand and to comply with study instructions and requirements. \n\n Pregnant or nursing (lactating) woman. \n\n Woman of child-bearing potential defined as woman physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless she is using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 21 days after stopping the treatment: \n\n total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient). \n\n female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. \n\n male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to study screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient. \n\n placement of an intrauterine device (IUD). \n\n use of condom + spermicide. \n\n Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), transdermal, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception as well as hormonal replacement therapy.",
    "brief_summary": "Patients with breast cancer, who have completed first line therapy (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery), and who have to be identified with having a high risk of recurrence of cancer, will be eligible for the study. This patient group is currently offered a standard of care chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy (ET). The study investigates whether the patient group with high-risk early breast cancer benefits from treatment with the medication abemaciclib in combination with ET compared to ET alone.",
