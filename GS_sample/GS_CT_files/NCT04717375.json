    "brief_summary": "This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BND-22 administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab or with cetuximab. The study will enroll advanced cancer patients with unresectable or metastatic disease who are refractory to or are not candidates for standard approved therapy and will be comprised of two parts - an initial 3 + 3 dose escalation phase followed by a dose expansion phase.",
