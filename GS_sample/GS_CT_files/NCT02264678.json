    "brief_summary": "This is a modular, phase I/ phase 1 b, open-label, multicentre study of ceralasertib administered orally in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and/or novel anti-cancer agents, to patients with advanced malignancies. The study design allows an investigation of optimal combination dose of ceralasertib with other anti-cancer treatments, with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. The initial combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with carboplatin. The second combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with Olaparib. The third combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with durvalumab. The fourth module will investigate the effect of food on ceralasertib absorption and the effect of ceralasertib on ECG parameter. The fifth module to be investigated is ceralasertib with AZD5305.",
