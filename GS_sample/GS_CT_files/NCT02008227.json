    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Known active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases \n\n Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with expected curative outcome \n\n History of autoimmune disease \n\n History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis), drug-induced pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted \n\n Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C \n\n Prior treatment with docetaxel \n\n Prior treatment with cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) agonists, anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4), anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1), or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or pathway-targeting agents",
    "brief_summary": "This global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] antibody)compared with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either docetaxel or atezolizumab. Treatment may continue as long as participants experienced clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.",
