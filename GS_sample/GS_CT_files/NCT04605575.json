    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n History of treatment with pyrotinib \n\n Prior treatment with lapatinib or neratinib \n\n History of other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma \n\n History of receiving any anti-cancer drug/biologic or investigational treatment within 28 days prior to randomization except hormone therapy \n\n Recovery of treatment-related toxicity consistent with other eligibility criteria \n\n History of radiation therapy within 28 days of randomization \n\n Brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms, as well as any history of radiation, surgery, or other therapy, including steroids, to control symptoms from brain metastases within 2 months (60 days) of randomization \n\n History of symptomatic congestive heart failure or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment \n\n History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina \n\n Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (for example, clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease) \n\n Pregnancy or lactation \n\n Current known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus \n\n Presence of conditions that could affect gastrointestinal absorption: Malabsorption syndrome, resection of the small bowel or stomach, and ulcerative colitis",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to identify the highest tolerable dose of pyrotinib in combination with vinorelbine and to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in Patients With HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer.~The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, testing will be done on up to 12 subjects to determine the highest tolerable dose of pyrotinib and vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the second part of the study, we will explore the safety and efficacy of Pyrotinib + vinorelbine in Patients With HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Prior Trastuzumab-Based Therapy. Participants will be treated until disease progression (PD), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination.",
