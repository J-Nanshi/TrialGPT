    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Adult (\u2265 18 years of age) pre or post-menopausal women with LABC or MBC not amenable to curative treatment by surgery or radiotherapy, progressing to a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. To be enrolled in the present trial patients must have relapsed at least after 12 months from the last CDK4/6 dosage in the adjuvant setting or at progression from a first line combined hormonal treatment for metastatic disease with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI or Tam with duration of, at least, 6 months.

Tissue biopsy of the most accessible metastatic site at study entry and at disease progression are required but not mandatory. \n\n Written informed consent obtained before any screening procedure and according to local guidelines. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n HER2-overexpressing patients by local laboratory testing (IHC3+ staining or in situ hybridization positive). \n\n Patients who received > 1 line of chemotherapy as treatment for MBC. \n\n Patients who received > 1 line of a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with hormonal treatment for LABC or MBC or who have relapsed at less than 12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. For metastatic disease, patients with a progressive disease within the first 6 months of treatment while on first line therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, will be excluded. \n\n Patients receiving chemotherapy or any type of hormonal therapy after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for metastatic disease. \n\n Patients interrupting the previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor for cardiac and/or hepatic toxicity and not for disease progression. \n\n Pregnant, lactating women. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, fulvestrant, or to any of the excipients. \n\n Radiotherapy within four weeks prior to enrollment (baseline/treatment start) except in case of localized radiotherapy for analgesic purpose or for lytic lesions at risk of fracture which can then be completed within two weeks prior to enrollment (baseline/treatment start). Patients must have recovered from radiotherapy toxicities prior to enrollment. \n\n Currently receiving hormone replacement therapy, unless discontinued prior to enrollment. \n\n Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents or chronic corticosteroids use, at the time of study entry except in cases outlined below: \n\n short duration (<2 weeks) of systemic corticosteroids is allowed (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anti-emetic); \n\n low doses of corticosteroids for brain metastasis treatment is allowed. \n\n Patients with symptomatic visceral disease in need of urgent disease control (e.g., significant dyspnea related to pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis and lung metastases or clinically meaningful symptomatic liver metastasis at the judgement of treating investigator). \n\n Symptomatic brain metastases. \n\n Patients with a known history of HIV seropositivity. \n\n Active, bleeding diathesis, or on oral anti-vitamin K medication (except low dose warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and acetylsalicylic acid or equivalent, as long as the INR is \u2264 2.0). \n\n Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as: unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction \u22646 months prior to enrollment, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia. \n\n Acute and chronic, active infectious disorders. \n\n Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study treatments (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome). \n\n Inability to swallow oral medications. \n\n Significant symptomatic deterioration of lung function. \n\n Patients being treated with drugs recognized as being strong inhibitors or inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A (Rifabutin, Rifampicin, Clarithromycin, Ketoconazole, Itroconazole, Voriconazole, Ritinavir, Telithromycin) within the last 5 days prior to enrollment. \n\n History of non-compliance to medical regimens. \n\n Patients refusing to perform liquid biopsy at study entry and disease progression. \n\n Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol.",
    "brief_summary": "The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palbociclib plus fulvestrant after failure of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen \u00b1 LHRHa) plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in women with HR+ and HER2- LABC or MBC.~Primary endpoint:~To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the combination treatment palbociclib plus fulvestrant at progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen \u00b1 LHRHa) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.~Clinical benefit rate for primary efficacy endpoints derivation will be based on the local (treating center's) radiologist's/investigator's tumor assessment.~For patients with measurable disease at baseline, progression will be determined according to the RECIST criteria v1.1.~In the absence of measurable disease at baseline, patients with bone only lesions, lytic or mixed (lytic + sclerotic), will be allowed to enter the study and the following will be considered disease progression among these patients:~The appearance of one or more new lytic lesions in bone,~The appearance of one or more new lesions outside of bone,~Unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions.~Note: Pathologic fracture, new compression fracture, or complications of bone metastases will not be considered as evidence of disease progression, unless one of the above-mentioned criteria is fulfilled.~To assess the Quality of Life (QoL) of patients receiving the combination treatment palbociclib plus fulvestrant at progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen \u00b1 LHRHa) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.~Secondary Endpoints:~To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of fulvestrant plus palbociclib at the progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen \u00b1 LHRHa) and CDK4/6 inhibitors with respect to:~Overall response rate (ORR)~Progression Free Survival (PFS)~Overall Survival (OS)~Safety and tolerability~To assess predictive biomarkers of response/resistance to fulvestrant plus palbociclib using metastatic tumor tissue samples and liquid biopsies.~This study will be performed in pre- and post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- LABC or MBC whose disease is progressing to a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen \u00b1 LHRHa).~Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first.",
