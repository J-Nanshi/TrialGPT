    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast \n\n Locally advanced breast cancer that is not amenable to curative radiation or surgical cure and/or metastatic disease appropriate for systemic single cytotoxic chemotherapy \n\n Documentation of a deleterious, suspected deleterious, or pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation from Myriad Genetics or other laboratory approved by the Sponsor \n\n No more than 3 prior chemotherapy-inclusive regimens for locally advanced and/or metastatic disease (no limit on prior hormonal therapies or targeted anticancer therapies such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) or CDK4/6 inhibitors, immune-oncology agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies against CTL4 or VEGF) \n\n Prior treatment with a taxane and/or anthracycline in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced, or metastatic setting unless medically contraindicated \n\n Have measurable or non-measurable, evaluable disease by the revised response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 \n\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 2 \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n First-line locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with no prior adjuvant chemotherapy unless the Investigator determines that one of the 4 cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in the control arm would otherwise be offered to the subject \n\n Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor (not including iniparib) \n\n Not a candidate for treatment with at least 1 of the treatments of protocol-specific physician's choice (ie, capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) \n\n Subjects who had objective disease progression while receiving platinum chemotherapy administered for locally advanced or metastatic disease; subjects who received low-dose platinum therapy administered in combination with radiation therapy are not excluded \n\n Subjects who have received platinum in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting are eligible; however, subjects may not have relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of prior platinum therapy \n\n Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days before randomization \n\n Radiation or anti-hormonal therapy or other targeted anticancer therapy within 14 days before randomization \n\n HER2 positive breast cancer \n\n Active inflammatory breast cancer \n\n CNS metastases \n\n Exception: Adequately treated brain metastases documented by baseline CT or MRI scan that has not progressed since previous scans and that does not require corticosteroids (except prednisone \u2264 5 mg/day or equivalent) for management of CNS symptoms. A repeat CT or MRI following the identification of CNS metastases (obtained at least 2 weeks after definitive therapy) must document adequately treated brain metastases. \n\n Subjects with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are not permitted \n\n Prior malignancy except for any of the following: \n\n Prior BRCA-associated cancer as long as there is no current evidence of the cancer \n\n Carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma skin cancer \n\n A cancer diagnosed and definitively treated \u2265 5 years before randomization with no subsequent evidence of recurrence \n\n Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive \n\n Known active hepatitis C virus, or known active hepatitis B virus \n\n Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of talazoparib",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this open-label, 2:1 randomized phase III trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) versus protocol-specific physician's choice in patients who have locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations.",
