    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Patients who are concurrently receiving other anti-tumor therapy; \n\n Bilateral breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer, or occult breast cancer; \n\n With a history of any malignancies other than breast cancer in the past 5 years, excluding cured cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer or other malignant tumors; \n\n Inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea and intestinal obstruction, and having many factors that affect drug administration and absorption; \n\n Cardiac insufficiency, including but not limited to congestive heart failure, transmural myocardial infarction, angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, clinically significant valvular disease and high-risk arrhythmia, or abnormal QTc in the ECG examination during the screening period (at rest, QTc > 450 ms in male or QTc > 470 ms in female after correction of ECG examination); \n\n Uncontrolled hypertension (at rest, systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg); \n\n Patients who are suffering severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, such as unstable or uncompensable respiratory, heart, liver, or kidney diseases, as per the investigator's judgments; \n\n Female patients during pregnancy and lactation, or those who are fertile and positive for baseline pregnancy test or those of childbearing age who are unwilling to take effective contraceptive measures throughout the trial period; \n\n Serious concomitant diseases or other comorbid diseases that will endanger the safety of patients or interfere with the completion of the trial, including but not limited to severe hypertension, severe diabetes mellitus, and active infections that are out of control; \n\n Patients with known allergies to any active ingredients or excipients of ARX788, or with a history of protein drug allergy, a history of specific allergies (asthma, rheumatism, eczematous dermatitis), or a history of other severe allergic reactions, who are unsuitable for ARX788 treatment as per the investigator's judgments; \n\n With a history of interstitial pulmonary disease, drug-induced pulmonary interstitial disease, and radiation pneumonitis that require hormone therapy, or any clinically active pulmonary interstitial disease as suggested by any evidence; \n\n Patients who are currently suffering from keratitis, corneal disease, retinal disease, or active eye infection that require any interventions for the eyes.",
    "brief_summary": "Next-generation Site-specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) is an antibody-conjugated drug. Results from the phase I safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of ARX788 single drug in Chinese patients with advanced HER2 breast cancer indicated a good safety of the test drug, and responses to anti-tumor therapy were observed in the target dose group. Phase II clinical trial is being carried out gradually. This trial is designed to observe the effectiveness and safety of pyrotinib maleate combined with ARX788 neoadjuvant treatment in stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients experiencing a poor efficacy of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.",
