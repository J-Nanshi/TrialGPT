Since \u03b2-HCG over expression can be also elevated in some tumor types, a positive result should be confirmed with a validated alternative test (e.g., ultrasound).",
    "brief_summary": "The multicenter, two-cohort, non-comparative, open-label, phase II clinical trial SABINA aims to analyze the safety and efficacy of MEN1611 in monotherapy and in combination with eribulin, a non-taxane chemotherapy agent, in Hormone Receptor (HR)-known/Human Epidermial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)/ Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN)-altered, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic metaplastic breast carcinoma (MpBC) patients.~A run-in phase for safety and tolerability of MEN1611 in combination with standard doses of eribulin will be conducted as an initial step of the cohort A. This first step aims at evaluating the dosing schedule of MEN1611, by analyzing the toxicity profile of the combined regimen.~With the background of the first-in-human study (PA-001EU), the safe dose of MEN1611 has been established as 48 mg orally BID (two intakes of 3 capsules of 16 mg each, for a total daily dose of 96 mg MEN1611 free-base).",
