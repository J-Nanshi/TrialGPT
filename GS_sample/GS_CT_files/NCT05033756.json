Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. \n\n Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. \n\n Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis. \n\n Known history of the following infections: \n\n Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). \n\n Acute or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C \n\n Active Tuberculosis \n\n Resting ECG indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QTcF prolongation >500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome. \n\n Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML. \n\n Preexisting use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting trial treatment is 2 weeks. \n\n Preexisting use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort ) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period prior to starting trial treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents. \n\n Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT). \n\n Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection; any condition that interferes with pembrolizumab or olaparib treatment. \n\n Unability to swallow or gastrointestinal disorders with reduced absorption of olaparib. \n\n Psychiatric or substance abuse disorders. \n\n A woman of childbearing potential who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to inclusion. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. \n\n Participants being pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. \n\n Any other condition in opinion of the investigator that would interfere with applied systemic treatment or other trial procedures",
