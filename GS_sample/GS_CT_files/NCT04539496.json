    "brief_summary": "This study includes Single agent/combination dose exploration study and the phase II study. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/recommended phase II dose(RP2D) of XZP-3287 and its efficacy and safety in hormone receptor(HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) negative advanced breast cancer.",
