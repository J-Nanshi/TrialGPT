    "brief_summary": "The primary objectives of this study are as follows:~Phase 1 (sequential dose-escalation): to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) as a single agent and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SG in Japanese participants with advance solid tumors.~Phase 2 (dose expansion): to evaluate the efficacy of SG in Japanese participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).",
