    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Female, age \u2265 18 years. \n\n Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of breast carcinoma. \n\n T2-4 breast cancer with measurable primary breast tumor, defined as palpable tumor with both diameters 2.0cm or greater as measured by caliper. \n\n Patients with synchronous breast tumors (ipsilateral or bilateral) may be enrolled, provided that none of the tumors is HER2 positive. Protocol-specific biopsy will be performed for each tumor, and each tumor will be assessed separately for pCR rate if the patient is non-metastatic \n\n Tumor must be HER2 negative by IHC (0 or 1+), or FISH (dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 with average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals/cell) \n\n Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. \n\n ECOG performance 0 or 1. \n\n Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. \n\n Adequate organ function including the following: \n\n - Bone marrow: Absolute neutrophil (segmented and bands) count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L Platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L \n\n - Hepatic: Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT or AST \u2264 2.5x ULN, (or \u22645 X with liver metastases) \n\n - Renal: Creatinine \u2264 1.5x ULN \n\n Left ventricular ejection fraction \u226550% \n\n Signed informed consent from patient or legal representative. \n\n Patients with reproductive potential must use an approved contraceptive method if appropriate (e.g., intrauterine device, birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for three months after the study. Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study enrollment. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. \n\n Treatment within the last 30 days with any investigational drug. \n\n Concurrent administration of any other tumor therapy, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy. \n\n Major surgery within 28 days of study drug administration. \n\n Active infection that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. \n\n Pregnancy. \n\n Breast feeding. \n\n Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the investigator. \n\n Active bleeding disorder or bleeding site. \n\n Non-healing wound. \n\n Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. \n\n Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment, with exception of a synchronous HER2 negative breast cancer that is not metastatic \n\n Symptomatic brain metastasis. \n\n History of significant neurological or mental disorder, including seizures or dementia. \n\n Known history of systemic connective tissue diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis), vasculitidies (e.g., giant cell arteritis, Kawasaki disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss disease) or sickle cell disease.",
    "brief_summary": "Background: The investigators previously studied the addition of low-dose, short-course sunitinib to pre-operative chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with measurable primary breast tumor in a phase Ib/II study at the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore. These data showed that the addition of sunitinib improved tumor vascularization as hypothesized with enhanced short-term treatment response. However, pathological complete response rate after 4 cycles of chemotherapy was not superior to standard chemotherapy, and may be attributed to dose delays from increased myelosuppression with the addition of sunitinib. The investigators hypothesize that this promising regimen may be further optimized with the use of growth factor support. The investigators thus plan to study the addition of low-dose, shortcourse sunitinib to dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ddAC) administered every 14 days, supported by pegfilgrastim.~Aim: To confirm that the addition of 12.5mg sunitinib for 5-7 days can be added before each cycle of ddAC (delivered every 14 days, supported by pegfilgrastim) without compromising dose intensity, in phase II open label single arm part of the study, followed by a phase II randomized study to compare the pathological complete response rate of ddAC versus sunitinib + ddAC in stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting.~Methods:A single-centre study comprising two phases: a. Phase II open label single-arm study that will enroll newly diagnosed stage I-IV HER2 negative breast cancer patients receiving either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (stage I-III patients) or first-line palliative chemotherapy (stage IV patients). All patients will be treated with 4 cycles of ddAC at standard doses (60/600mg/m2) every 2 weeks, supported by subcutaneous pegfilgrastim 6mg, to be administered 24-36 hours after each dose of chemotherapy. Low dose sunitinib at 12.5mg daily orally will be administered for 7 days prior to cycle 1 ddAC, and for 5 days prior to each subsequent cycle of ddAC. b. Phase II randomized study that will enroll newly diagnosed stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before definitive breast cancer surgery. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to 4 cycles of ddAC with or without intermittent sunitinib in patients with measurable primary breast cancer who are receiving preoperative chemotherapy.",
