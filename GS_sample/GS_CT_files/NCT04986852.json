    "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Female patients \u226519 years old \n\n Histologically proven metastatic triple-negative breast cancer* irrespective of PD-L1 status. \n\n *Histological or cytological diagnosis of relapsed/metastatic triple receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC).TNBC is defined negatively expression of estrogen(ER), progesterone(PR) and human epidermal receptor-2(HER2). If there is a pathology report of the metastasis, take the histopathology of the metastases as standard. Negative of ER and PR is defined as expression of ER, PR<1% of the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2-negative is defined as a score of 0 and 1+ by IHC, or IHC 2+ & fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) negative. If the ER2 test result is 0 or 1+ by IHC, FISH detection is optional, but the result must be negative. \n\n Has provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue. \n\n - Note: If submitting unstained cut slides, newly cut slides should be submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut \n\n Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the local site investigator/radiology.

    "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n A patient who meets any of the following criteria is excluded from participating in this study. \n\n Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. \n\n - Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent. \n\n Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment \n\n Treatment with systemic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit \n\n Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.

For patients with \u22652+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis, a urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio will be determined, or a 24-hour urine collection will be done. Patients with a UPC ratio <1 or a 24-hour urine protein <1 gram are eligible. \n\n History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation, or serious GI bleeding within 6 months \n\n History of severe arterial thromboembolic event within 12 months of start of study drug \n\n Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment.
