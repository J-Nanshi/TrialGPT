(Tumor-free margins at least 1 mm for both invasive and noninvasive carcinoma except for lobular carcinoma in situ (less than 1 mm allowed); \n\n Histologically confirmed ER(-) PR(-) and HER-2(IHC(immunohistochemistry) 0-1+ or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) negative) \n\n Next-generation sequencing confirmed homologous recombination repair deficiency \n\n Meet one of the following criteria: \n\n (1) Positive axillary lymph nodes; (2) Negative axillary lymph nodes with at least one of the following risk factors: age<= 35 years; grade III; infiltrative tumor size > 2cm; intravascular tumor embolus; Ki-67>=50%. \n\n 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score 0-1 7. Adequate bone marrow reserve with ANC > 1500, HGB > 9g/dL and platelets > 100,000. \n\n 8. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine < 2.0. 9. Adequate hepatic reserve with serum bilirubin < 2.0, AST/ALT < 2X the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase < 5X the upper limit of normal. Serum bilirubin > 2.0 is acceptable in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. \n\n 10. Not pregnant, and on appropriate birth control if of child-bearing potential. \n\n 11. Written informed consent according to the local ethics committee requirements. \n\n ",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this trial is to compare the 3-year disease-free survival of dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with paclitaxel plus carboplatin as adjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer with homologous recombination repair deficiency.~The other purpose of this trial is to observe the patient's tolerance.",
