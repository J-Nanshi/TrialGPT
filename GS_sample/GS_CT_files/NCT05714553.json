This criterion does not apply to patients who have had a previous hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Male patients and female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to practice true abstinence or to use two forms of contraception, one of which must be highly effective. These forms of contraception must be used from the time of signing consent, throughout the treatment period, and for 6 months following the last dose of any study medication. Oral or injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception. \n\n Patients must have been advised to take measures to avoid or minimize exposure to UV light for the duration of study participation and for a period of 4 weeks following the last dose of study medication. \n\n Additional Module 1 inclusion criteria: \n\n Confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumour, with evidence of locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease, for which pembrolizumab treatment would be appropriate (e.g., melanoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, NSCLC, RCC, urothelial carcinoma, HNSCC, cSCC, oesophageal carcinoma, MSI high CRC, gastric cancer, TNBC, and endometrial carcinoma). \n\n Must have progressed on \u22642 prior lines of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease, that may have included 1 prior line of an immunotherapy-containing regimen (either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy).

Additional prior lines of treatment with targeted agents or immunotherapy are allowed as long as they were not given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prior regimens in which one drug is substituted for another due to toxicity count as 1 line of treatment. Prior treatment with docetaxel for metastatic disease is not allowed. \n\n Adequate liver function, as defined by serum total bilirubin <ULN, AST and ALT \u22642.5\u00d7ULN (or \u22645\u00d7ULN if liver metastases are present). In the event of concomitantly increased ALP values >2.5\u00d7ULN, AST and ALT must be <1.5\u00d7ULN. \n\n ",
    "exclusion_criteria": " (all modules): \n\n History of hypersensitivity or current contra-indications to 5-FU, floxuridine (FUDR), capecitabine (refer to latest package inserts), or the components of the NUC-3373 drug product formulation (super refined polysorbate 80 [SRP80], dimethylacetamide [DMA]). \n\n Symptomatic central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastases. \n\n Symptomatic ascites, ascites currently requiring drainage procedures or ascites requiring drainage over the 3 months prior to date of first dose of study drug. \n\n Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy (other than a short cycle of palliative radiotherapy, e.g., for bone pain*), immunotherapy, biological agents, or exposure to another investigational agent within 21 days (or four times the half-life for molecular targeted agents, whichever is shorter) of first administration of study treatment: \n\n For nitrosoureas and mitomycin C within 6 weeks of first administration of NUC-3373 \n\n Corticosteroid treatment is allowed during screening but should be weaned to a dose of 10 mg prednisolone (or steroid equivalent) by Cycle 1 Day 1 * Palliative radiotherapy during participation in the study is permitted, but should not be concurrent with study treatment and recovery should be allowed to prevent overlapping toxicity. It should not include a target lesion. \n\n Residual toxicities from prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy which have not regressed to Grade \u22641 severity (CTCAE v5.0), except for alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity (which are excluded if \u2265Grade 3). \n\n Uncontrolled concurrent cancer other than the indication under investigation. Patients with a concurrent cancer whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with safety or efficacy assessment are eligible. \n\n Presence of an active bacterial or viral infection (including SARS-CoV- 2, Herpes Zoster or chicken pox), or known active hepatitis B or C. \n\n Presence of any uncontrolled concurrent serious illness, medical condition or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the Investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the study or with the interpretation of the results, including any of the following: \n\n Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV) \n\n Clinically significant coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months of the first dose of study medication or high risk of uncontrolled arrythmia \n\n Unstable or poorly controlled angina pectoris \n\n Complete left bundle branch, bifascicular block or other clinically significant abnormal ECG finding \n\n QTc interval >470 milliseconds \n\n History of or current risk factor for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalaemia, or a family history of long QT syndrome) \n\n History of severe skin reactions \n\n History of severe ocular disorders \n\n Interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis \n\n Any condition (e.g., known or suspected poor compliance, psychological instability, geographical location, etc.) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the patient's ability to sign the informed consent and undergo study procedures. \n\n Currently pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding. \n\n Required concomitant use of drugs known to prolong QT/QTc interval. \n\n Required concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

    "brief_summary": "This study is an open-label, multi-arm, parallel cohort, dose validation and expansion design. The study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the safety, efficacy and PK of NUC-3373 in combination with other agents for the treatment of patients with different tumour types.~Each module is designed to evaluate a different NUC-3373 combination and consists of a dose-validation phase (Phase Ib) and a dose-expansion phase (Phase II).~Phase Ib of each module will determine the safety and tolerability of the combinations for further clinical evaluation in Phase II. Approximately 6-20 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Phase Ib stage of each module to determine safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of NUC-3373 in combination with other agents. Each module will then move into Phase II to enable a further assessment of safety and efficacy in approximately 20-40 patients.~Module 1 will assess NUC-3373 + leucovorin (LV) in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumours who have progressed on \u22642 prior therapies for metastatic disease, that may have included 1 prior immunotherapy-containing regimen (either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy) or who have not progressed but where addition of NUC-3373 + LV to standard pembrolizumab monotherapy may be appropriate (e.g., patients who could not tolerate post-IO standard of care therapy).~Module 2 will assess NUC-3373 + LV in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pleural mesothelioma who have progressed on, or were unable to tolerate, 1 or 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy-containing regimens for advanced/metastatic disease.~The opening of each module will be at the discretion of the Sponsor. Further modules may be added as non-clinical and clinical data become available to support additional NUC-3373 combinations and tumour types.",
