Patients must have evidence of progressive disease on study entry after at least one line of anti-cancer therapy. Patients will be stratified into platinum-na\u00efve (not having been treated with platinums-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative setting), platinum sensitive (defined as having prior objective response or sustained disease control lasting \u22656 months to platinum-containing chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, or relapsed \u22656 months after completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinums-containing chemotherapy), and platinum resistant (defined as having progressive disease as the best response or disease control <6 months to platinum-containing chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, or relapsed <6 months after completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinums-containing chemotherapy). \n\n There is no upper limit on the number of prior treatments provided all inclusion/",

    "brief_summary": "This is a single arm, open-label, phase I dose finding study, followed by a phase II expansion study. Phase I will be carried out in a modified 3+3 dose escalation design, with a projected enrolment of 33 patients with refractory solid tumors to determine the RP2D. In the phase II portion, a total of 30 patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC will be enrolled.",
