    "brief_summary": "This Phase 1b/2a study will assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of CyPep-1 when administered directly into measurable tumor lesions in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Additionally, the study will assess anti-tumor effects of CyPep-1 on injected lesions and non-injected target lesions identified at baseline, as well as local and systemic immunological effects of CyPep-1 in combination with pembrolizumab.",
