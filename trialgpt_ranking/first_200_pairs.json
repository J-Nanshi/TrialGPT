Specifically, the study will evaluate the change in IML following a 2-hour training run and the recovery of IML in response to the post-exercise low-fat or moderate-fat diet in 10 endurance trained athletes who will consume both diets in a randomly assigned cross-over fashion. We hypothesize that IML will be depleted with prolonged endurance exercise, and that replenishment of IML will be impaired by an extremely low-fat diet compared to a moderate-fat diet. Results of this pilot study will be used to apply for extramural grant support from NIH or the US Armed Forces to investigate the effect of dietary fat on the health and performance of individuals performing heavy physical training. It is anticipated that this methodology could also be employed in obesity research to delineate, longitudinally, the reported cross-sectional relationships among IML stores, insulin resistance and obesity."

Children will participate in one of two programs conducted in childcare centers 5 days a week for 1 year. One program will involve activities that use large muscles (gross motor activity). The other will involve activities using small muscles (fine motor activity). We will give a calcium supplement (1 gram per day) to half of the children in each program and give the other half an inactive pill. We will measure bone mass and bone mineral density at the beginning and end of the study.

The life-threatening connotations of cancer single out the ill child from his peer/family group as one who is different, and often unable to maintain a normal lifestyle. Physical sequelae of cancer and its treatment accentuate the differences between these children and their normal peers/siblings.~It is important that children with cancer be prepared to function outside of protected situations and begin to develop skills of separation and independence. For healthy children, some of these latter skills are acquired by a camping experience. Such an experience for the patient with cancer is frequently precluded by their dependence on medical facilities and the physical limitations of their activities.~The goal of this study will be to assess the short and long term benefits of the normalized camping experience, provided in conjunction with Special Love, Inc., on the patients and staff. In particular, we will seek to determine whether such a comprehensive experience is capable of influencing the attitudes and life experiences of patients and staff in a positive manner.~Objectives:~-To evaluate the impact of an enriched normalized camping experience on the quality of life of the pediatric cancer patient.

In this study researchers will attempt to determine how the amount of water consumed affects the level of vitamin C in the blood (specifically the plasma component of the blood).~In this study researchers will take 13 subjects and place them on a Vitamin C restricted diet. Vitamin C levels will be measured twice a week on an outpatient basis until all subjects reach a desired low level of Vitamin C (12-15 micromolar plasma ascorbic acid concentration). Subjects will then be admitted and undergo 24 hour blood and urine collection. Following the collection of samples, subjects will then begin to receive Vitamin C orally (by mouth) and intravenously (injected into the vein). The dosage of Vitamin C will gradually increase from 30 mg-2500 mg divided into two daily doses. Blood and urine samples will be collected each time the dose is increased. The study will take approximately 18 weeks after which the subjects will be discharged in healthy condition."

        "brief_summary": "Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected individuals. There is at least a 10 fold greater viral burden per given number of CD4+ T lymphocytes obtained from the lymph nodes versus the peripheral blood in the same infected individual. These data have been accumulated predominantly in individuals with progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC Class A1 and A2). It is unclear at present whether this pattern holds true for all categories of HIV infected individuals. We have proposed that the seeding of lymph nodes by HIV early in the course of HIV infection and the persistent production of virus in lymph nodes throughout the course of infection are major factors in the pathogenesis of HIV in virtually all infected individuals. In addition, it is likely that the selective perturbations of various T cell subsets (i.e., V-B classes of CD4+T cells) that have been observed in peripheral blood are much more dramatic in the lymph node given the greater viral burden in the lymph node compared to the peripheral blood. In order to investigate this hypothesis, it is essential that we study simultaneously lymph nodes and peripheral blood from the same individuals and that we study different individuals at various stages of disease from early in the course of infection (CDC Class A) to advanced disease (CDC Class B and C). If, as we suspect, there is active virus replication in the lymph node early in the course of infection, even at a time when there is little virus burden or active replication in the peripheral blood, this would justify anti-retroviral therapy at the earliest possible time in the course of infection. In addition, in certain patients who are about to initiate treatment with an anti-retroviral agent such as zidovudine or didanosine through their private physician, it would be important to know whether treatment actually reduces the viral burden and virus replication in lymph nodes. The effect of therapy on viral burden and replication will be compared in the lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and both of these parameters will be compared with the level of plasma viremia."

Blood tests will be taken on the day of the biopsy to have an overall idea of the hormones circulating in the patient's blood. An endometrial biopsy will be taken at one of three possible times to identify endometrial products under conditions of estrogen, estrogen/progesterone, or steroid hormone withdrawal.<TAB>"

        "brief_summary": "Patients with lung disease experiencing difficulty breathing can be treated with oxygen therapy. This involves the delivery of extra oxygen by a face-mask or through small tubes placed in the nose called nasal prongs. This extra oxygen can have concentrations as high as 100% pure oxygen. The concentration of oxygen in normal air is only 21%. The high concentration of oxygen can help to provide enough oxygen for all of the organs in the body. Unfortunately, breathing 100% oxygen for long periods of time can cause changes in the lungs, which are potentially harmful. Researchers believe that by lowering the concentration of oxygen therapy to 40% patients can receive it for longer periods of time without the risk of side effects.~This study is designed to evaluate the effects of oxygen therapy at 100% and 40% for 12 18 hours on the lungs of normal volunteers. Results of this study will help to determine if levels of oxygen therapy currently accepted as being safe may actually be damaging to the lungs."

The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of exercise intensity on the time constant describing changes in VO2 (tauVO2) during recovery from one minute of constant work rate exercise. Five normal healthy volunteers ages 18 and older will perform a progressive maximal aerobic exercise test, using a cycle ergometer, to determine VO2max and lactate threshold (LT) estimated by gas exchange. Each subject will also complete a series of maximal constant work rate tests and submaximal constant work rate tests at 80% LT and 50% of the difference between LT and VO2max (50% delta). Breath by breath variability and VO2 span will be used to determine the number of constant work rate test repetitions, for each subject for each exercise intensity, needed to establish confidence in tauVO2. A mean response profile of VO2 recovery kinetics for each exercise intensity will be analyzed using non-linear regression to determine tauVO2. To examine the effect of exercise intensity on tauVO2, one way analysis of variance will be used to determine whether differences exist among maximal and submaximal (80% LT and 50% delta) time constants. We hypothesize that there will be no significant differences among time constants for VO2 during recovery from maximal and submaximal constant work rate exercise lasting one minute. The results of this study are expected to provide increased understanding of the measurement of VO2 kinetics during recovery."

        "brief_summary": "This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes replicate (divide) and how long they live in both HIV-infected and non-infected people by measuring how quickly the genetic material (DNA) of cells is replicated. To do this, participants will receive infusions of glucose, a non-radioactive form of a type of sugar. Cells normally use glucose to make various products needed for cell growth and replication, including cell DNA. Measuring how much glucose cells incorporate into their DNA can provide important information about cell replication. This rate of incorporation will be examined and compared in HIV-infected people and in healthy, normal volunteers.~HIV-infected patients and non-infected healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests.~Participants will be given a continuous infusion of glucose at a dose of up to 60 grams (about 2 ounces) per day for up to 5 days. The glucose will be delivered through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. Blood samples will be collected as often as daily in the first week following the infusion and then from twice a week to once a month for up to 4 years. Alternatively, patients may undergo leukapheresis a procedure for collecting quantities of lymphocytes up to 10 times during the first month after the infusion, and possibly later as well, but no more often than once every 2 weeks. For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm. Participants may be asked to receive up to four glucose infusions. There will be at least a 2-week interval between infusions. Participants who have more than three leukapheresis procedures within 3 weeks will have at least 6 weeks between infusions.~Participants will be followed periodically in the outpatient clinic for evaluation and tests.~This study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and progressive weakening of the immune system and how therapies affect immunity."

        "brief_summary": "Simultaneous use of alternative or complementary medical therapies by cancer patients undergoing conventional medical treatment is extremely common and may not always be disclosed to the patient's treating physician. Cancer patients undergoing Phase I therapy on clinical trials constitute a special population of patients, since by definition, their prescribed therapy is scientifically unproven in terms of efficacy. Phase I patients are closely monitored for adverse effects in order to identify and characterize the toxicities and to define a tolerable dose of their experimental treatment. Thus, the unrecognized use of alternative therapies by patients actively enrolled in phase I trials may potentially confound rational drug development by causing adverse side effects or by contributing to drug interactions. Examples of clinical toxicities induced by alternative medical treatments include liver dysfunction or renal failure caused by herbal preparations, or hematologic abnormalities, such as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome caused by tryptophan food supplements. Therefore, it is important to document and determine the prevalence of alternative therapy use in this specific patient population; however, this issue has not previously been examined in a scientifically rigorous manner. We propose to conduct a survey and interview study of phase I cancer patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute to determine the prevalence of alternative therapy use in this population. This study will also examine patient attitudes and perceptions regarding their use of alternative therapy as compared with their scientifically-sanctioned phase I experimental therapy. This information has important implications for drug development."

This study seeks to determine the pharmacokinetics of genistein in humans by administering a single dose of genistein and performing a pharmacokinetic analysis. Patients will be treated with two formulations of genistein (a 43% genistein preparation or a 90% preparation). This is a phase I study, and patients will be treated on one of three dosing levels. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one formulation first, followed by a washout period, and will then receive the second preparation (i.e. a randomized cross over design).

NIH and FDA investigators requesting blood components for research use will be required to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo of request, briefly describing the nature of the research, and providing assurance that samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo research. This protocol also provides a detailed schema for careful and frequent laboratory safety monitoring of repeat research apheresis donors.~Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and the DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code that links the product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the blood and components collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol, and is not possible to describe, since it involves basic investigative efforts in greater than 170 different NIH and FDA laboratories. The intent of this protocol is not to approve the research itself, but to provide adequate and complete informed consent for the donor, and to assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study subjects (research blood donors) is performed in accordance with IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other applicable Federal regulatory standards..."

        "brief_summary": "On a yearly basis there are approximately 12,000 kidney transplants in the United States. Presently there are approximately 40,000 patients awaiting a transplant with only 5,000 available donors. Due to the obvious difference between organ supply and demand, live donors have become a standard source of kidneys for transplantation.~Research has proven that kidneys from living donors are superior to cadaveric donors (kidneys harvested from a deceased individual). Kidneys from living donors are not exposed to extremely low temperature that could increase post-operative problems. They are less likely to experience rejection and there is a decreased likelihood that a patient will have to undergo post-operative dialysis.~The objective of this study is to promote the enrollment of healthy individuals to serve as kidney donors for patients undergoing research kidney transplantation at the NIH. Potential donors will be screened to make sure they are able to survive with a single kidney without significant medical risk. Additional tests will be taken to establish compatibility with the recipient. Compatible donors will be evaluated to determine which kidney is suitable for transplantation. Both the donation and transplantation procedure will be conducted on the same day. Appropriate post-operative care and follow-up will be provided at the Clinical Center."

        "brief_summary": "The most common problem following a kidney transplant is the development of acute or chronic rejection. Rejection is the immunologic reaction in which the body refuses to accept the transplanted organ. The body's immune system will make destructive antibodies that will attempt to attack the transplanted organ.~In order to prevent organ rejection, all patients receiving an allograft (a graft transplanted between genetically non-identical individuals of the same species) must take anti-rejection therapy. These medications function by lowering the body's natural immune system. Often these medications are associated with significant side effects ranging from infections to cancer.~This study is designed to test whether the drug presently known as BG9588 (Antova TM) can reduce the incidence of organ rejection following kidney transplants in humans. More specifically, the study will attempt to assess the safety of BG9588 when given alone or when given in combination with other anti-rejection therapies. Safety will be measured by the amount of acute or chronic rejections, and immunological graft losses.~Subjects for the study will be made up of non-human primates (monkeys) and humans. Up to 5 subjects in each of the groups receiving kidney transplants will be placed on a 12 month course of BG9588 with or without additional anti-rejection drugs. BG9588 will be given intravenously (injected through a vein) prior to the transplant and then in a decreased dose with a decreased frequency over the year. Following the 12 months of therapy subjects may be eligible for additional monthly therapy.~The long-term follow up will occur through 30 months after the last dose of BG9588. Subjects will undergo periodic tests and evaluations throughout the course of the study. These tests will assess the body's immune system and detect the presence of rejection."

It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells.

A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.~Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.~At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment.

Women of reproductive potential will undergo a pregnancy test. Participants will be given either dextroamphetamine or placebo (an inactive solution) on two occasions separated by at least 3 to 7 days.

        "brief_summary": "This study will investigate the effect of the drug miconazole on blood vessel dilation. Miconazole stops production of EDHF, a substance that causes arteries to dilate. EDHF is produced by the cells that line blood vessels.~Normal volunteers between the ages of 21 to 60 may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened for eligibility with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine laboratory tests. Those enrolled will be injected with miconazole to study its effects on blood vessels.~Study participants will take three aspirin tablets. After administration of a local anesthetic, small tubes will be inserted through a needle into the artery and vein of the forearm. These will be used to measure blood pressure and to draw blood samples during the study. Forearm blood flow will be measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood will flow into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement will be recorded.~Small doses of four drugs-bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside, miconazole, and LNMMA-will be given through the arterial catheter. Bradykinin stimulates the release of EDHF and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Miconazole is commonly prescribed to treat various infections, including vaginal yeast infections, jock itch and athlete's foot. In much higher doses, it is used to treat fungal infections that have spread to the lungs, brain, kidneys, or bladder. LNMMA inhibits production of nitric oxide, another substance produced by the lining cells of blood vessels.~Blood flow will be measured throughout the study, which will last approximately 3 hours."

        "brief_summary": "The purpose of this investigation is to develop improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and hardware for studying brain function. MRI is a diagnostic tool that provides information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will evaluate new MRI methods for monitoring blood flow to regions of the brain in response to simple tasks. The MRI machine used in this study is more powerful than those in most hospitals, permitting a higher visual resolution.~Normal healthy volunteers over 18 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and questionnaire, and a neurological examination. Study participants will have a yearly MRI scan. For this procedure, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into a donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. A lightweight circular or rectangular coil a device that improves the quality of the images may be placed on the head. The scan time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours; most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, the subject may perform simple tasks, such as listening to tapes, tapping a finger, moving a hand, watching a screen, or smelling a fragrance. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons.~Information from this study will be used to develop better imaging methods that will, in turn, permit a greater understanding of normal and abnormal brain behaviors."

This study will try to determine how the genetic component of handedness is inherited. It will test the theory that a single gene is involved in determining handedness and will try to locate the gene.~Families with at least two left-handed siblings aged eight years or older and at least one right-handed parent are eligible to participate in this study.~The left-handed siblings and both parents will fill out a brief questionnaire on hand usage, obtain a tissue sample taken from inside the cheek, and return the questionnaire and the sample by mail to the study researchers. The tissue sample will be used for DNA gene mapping.~Participants will be given a kit and instructions for obtaining the sample, along with mailing envelopes. Cheek swab sampling basically involves using a small brush to gently brush a layer of cells off of the inner wall of the cheek and then dropping the brush tip into a preservative.~The information gained from this study may provide insight into aspects of brain development that can be of medical benefit in the future."

Women who are recently menopausal (50-60 yrs. of age) and over 20 years postmenopausal (>70 yrs. of age) will take estrogen or placebo for three months. At the end of that time they will participate in three challenges using dietary techniques to briefly change the relative amounts of neurotransmitters in the brain that are believed to be related to mood regulation (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine). Previous research has shown that these dietary manipulations can briefly produce negative changes in mood. The investigator hypothesizes that estrogen administration will blunt or buffer these negative effects in a quantifiable way. The investigator believes that this will provide a direct test of the ability of estrogen to meaningfully change the brain chemistry of mood in a clinically measurable and positive way. The proposed procedure will also allow assessment of the effects of estrogen on brain neurotransmitter systems after many years of very low estrogen levels."

De qi can be perceived by the acupuncturist in the form of needle grasp, a mechanical gripping of the needle by the tissue. De qi is considered essential to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Therefore, the investigator proposes that understanding this local tissue reaction will lead to an understanding of how the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy arises. Specifically, it is hypothesized that needle manipulation causes winding of collagen and elastic fibers around the needle. This action induces tension in the collagen network surrounding the needling site and results in a mechanical signal that is transduced into local cells. The objective of the current work is to use ultrasound elastography, a recently developed ultrasound imaging technique, to visualize and quantify changes in the elastic properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue in 12 healthy human volunteers as a result of acupuncture needle manipulation."

Three groups of women athletes with differing estrogen and progesterone profiles (normal menstrual cycles, amenorrheic, and exogenous estrogen supplementation) and one control group (male collegiate athletes) will be used to compare differences in joint laxity and neuromuscular function. Blood levels of estrogen and progesterone will be measured at four time points across the menstrual cycle. Joint laxity and muscle reaction time will also be measured at each of these points. The investigator hypothesizes that knee and ankle joint laxity and muscle reaction time will significantly increase with increasing estrogen and progesterone levels."

Successful transplantation of clusters (islets) of normal cells, that include those which produce the sugar-lowering hormone insulin, from the pancreas of a person who did not have diabetes into a person with diabetes should eliminate high blood sugar levels. We wish to determine if it will also eliminate low blood sugar. To do so we will give insulin to lower the blood sugar, measure the levels of the hormones that normally raise blood sugar levels (e.g., glucagon and epinephrine) and then stop the insulin and see if blood sugar levels return to normal. Because we anticipate that the transplanted islets will produce insulin, but not glucagon, this study may also tell us if regulated insulin production alone can prevent hypoglycemia in humans."

This and other low-carbohydrate diets, such as the ZONE, Sugar Busters, and the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet, have attracted much popular attention but little scientific evaluation. Given the widespread use of these diets, it seems prudent to evaluate them both for safety and efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two different weight control programs over the course of 52 weeks. These two programs are 1) the Atkins' New Diet Revolution, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, and 2) Brownell's LEARN Program, a high carbohydrate, low fat diet based on behavior modification. Specifically, this study will compare short-term changes in weight, food intake, blood chemistries and mood in adult males (n=10) and females (n=10) who are randomized to either the Atkins' Diet or the LEARN Program for a period of one year. During this year, they will be under medical supervision. We will examine the effect of the two weight loss plans on changes in lipids, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and ketones, and eating behavior. This is a feasibility study and thus the data will ultimately be used to design a large randomized trial with adequate statistical power."

Maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity and the activity of this combination will be assessed.~This chemotherapy regimen is a two-pronged attack at the way cancer cells replicate. R115777 is a compound that may inhibit cancer cell growth by interfering with the p21 ras oncogene, while topotecan, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, works on cancer cells not subject to control by the ras oncogene. Animal studies suggest that the combination may be synergistic. Another advantage is that R115777 can be taken by mouth."

Evidence suggests that a a network of brain regions selects relevant information and filters out irrelevant information when people view cluttered visual scenes. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how the different brain regions involved in attentional control and filtering interact.~Participants in this study will undergo computer tests, an MRI scan, and TMS. During the MRI, participants will look at pictures and count objects appearing on a screen. During the TMS, participants will perform a computer test.

        "brief_summary": "St. John's Wort is a popular dietary supplement that many patients-including those with epilepsy or seizures-take in addition to their regular medicines to elevate mood or relieve stress. Preliminary research indicates that this supplement can speed the metabolism of the anti-seizure drug Tegretol, causing reduced blood levels of the drug. Patients who take Tegretol to control their seizures may have more frequent seizures if the blood level of the drug drops too low. A recent study shows that this effect is not seen when Tegretol is taken for at least 3 weeks. The present study will examine whether there is a medically important drug interaction between St. John's wort and Tegretol when Tegretol is taken for 1 day.~Normal healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years old who are not taking medicines that can affect the metabolism of drugs in the liver and have not used St. John's wort for at least 30 days may be eligible for this 25-day study.~Participants will take a 400-mg dose of Tegretol after fasting overnight. Blood samples will be drawn the next day during a 12-hour clinic stay at the following intervals: just before the Tegretol dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 34, 48 and 72 hours after the dose. A catheter will be placed in the vein to prevent the need for multiple needle sticks until after the 10-hour sample. After completing the blood sampling, participants will take 300 mg of St. John's wort 3 times a day with meals for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, another fasting dose of Tegretol will be given and the 72-hour blood study will be repeated.~This study may provide information important for the care of patients with epilepsy who take both Tegretol and St. John's Wort."

More information on the structure and function of the human tongue is needed to develop better treatments for people with certain diseases affecting speech and swallowing.~Normal volunteers between 21 and 80 years old who live in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination, including suitability for MRI testing, and a brief examination of tongue, lip and jaw movements.~Participants will undergo ultrasound and MRI studies. During both tests, they will perform tongue exercises, such as holding a soft round object on the tongue or exerting tongue pressure against the back of the throat or roof of the mouth.~During the ultrasound, the subject lies on a flattened dental chair. A small transducer is placed under the chin to take images of the tongue during the exercises. A thin rubber strip with air-filled pressure bulbs is attached to the roof of the mouth (with dental adhesive) to measure tongue pressure.~For the MRI, the subject lies on a table that slides inside a donut's machine containing a magnetic field. MRI coils-special padded sensors that improve image quality-are placed around the head and neck. A pressure cuff placed around the arm measures blood pressure. The subject wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping noises that occur during electrical switching of the magnetic fields. The subject is in constant visual contact with the researchers and MR technologist and may request to stop the study at any time.~Participants may undergo another procedure, called magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, to examine how the fluid (water) in the tongue tissue shifts during tongue maneuvers. This procedure is essentially the same as the first MRI study, but two small round coils are placed in the mouth (one on each side) between the cheeks and the teeth."

        "brief_summary": "This study will examine how kava-a widely used herbal remedy-may affect the body's elimination of other medicines. Many people take kava to reduce anxiety or cause sedation. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug, it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result, information has not been collected on possible interactions between kava and other medications. This study will look at how kava affects the elimination of caffeine-a compound commonly found in chocolate, coffee, tea and soft drinks-and dextromethorphan-an OTC cough suppressant.~Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 30-day study. Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine blood tests. Women of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test.~Study participants will not drink alcoholic beverages or take any medications (except those given in the study) for 2 weeks prior to the study and throughout its duration. In addition, they will abstain from caffeine, grapefruit and grapefruit juice and charbroiled foods for at least 72 hours before and throughout each study day that urine is collected.~On day 1 of the study, study subjects will take one dose each of caffeine and dextromethorphan at 4:00 P.M.. They will empty their bladder before the dosing and then collect all their urine after the dosing for the rest of the day and including the next mornings first urine. They will bring the urine samples to the Clinical Center when the collection is complete. This procedure will be repeated 1 week later (study day 8). After the second urine collection is completed, subjects will take 200 milligrams of kava 3 times a day for 21 days. On study day 29 (after 21 days of kava), subjects will repeat the dextromethorphan and caffeine dosing and urine collection described above, while continuing to take kava.~Subjects will have an electroencephalograph (EEG) done before starting kava and again at the end of kava (study day 30). For this procedure, several electrodes (metal cups attached to wires) are secured to the scalp with a glue-like substance. A conductive gel fills the space between the electrode and the scalp to ensure good contact. The electrodes will remain in place for about 2 hours and then removed. The subject lies quietly on a bed during the EEG recording.~Participation in the study will end with another physical examination and blood tests following the second EEG and urine collection."

        "brief_summary": "This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and will examine whether it causes an immune response to HIV virus proteins. A vaccine is given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of two HIV proteins called gag and pol. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or proteins that may be made from it.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual activity and drug use. They will have a physical examination, blood tests, urine test and chest X-ray. All candidates enrolled in the study must use a barrier method of contraception for sexual intercourse from the start of the study until 3 months after the last vaccination.~Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: one will receive the experimental vaccine; the other will receive a control substance (inactive salt solution). The first five people assigned to the vaccine group will receive the lowest study dose of the vaccine. If this dose is safe, it will be increased three times for the next group of five and then eight times for the last group of five. Each group will have a total of seven people - five will receive the vaccine and two will get the salt solution.~Before the first injection, and possibly the second and third, a catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed into a vein so that treatment can be given quickly if there is a reaction to the vaccine. Participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector. For each injection, the volunteer will~be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization~record temperature and symptoms, including any effects at the injection site, for 2 days and report them to the clinic staff~immediately report any side effects to a study physician or nurse.~Volunteers will have physical examinations and laboratory tests at certain times while they receive the vaccine and for a period afterwards. These procedures will require about 14 clinic visits of about 1 to 2 hours each, and up to 6 hours on vaccination days. Blood will be drawn at all visits. Some of the blood will be used for genetic tests, and some will be stored for future tests of the immune system and the body's response to the study vaccine. The study will last about 12 months from the date of the first injection. After it is completed, clinic staff may contact volunteers once or twice a year for at least 3 years to follow up."

Unabated distress not only interferes with smooth progression of the ongoing procedure, but can elicit adverse responses when patients need additional intervention. The long-term objective of this research is to provide a safe and practical behavioral method for reducing cognitive and physiologic distress associated with invasive procedures. Currently, this method should benefit at least 8 million patients annually in the US. Extrapolating the risk of intravenous conscious sedation to the number of invasive procedures performed annually, we predict that 47,000 patients will suffer serious cardiorespiratory complications and 2,600 will die. These numbers do not include effects of the psychological damage inflicted by poorly managed procedure-related stress on patients' subsequent health behavior. This application sets out to pursue three aims: 1) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations; 2) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on distress in the postoperative period; 3) Determine the impact of intraprocedural self-hypnotic relaxation on distress during subsequent tumor embolization. We hypothesize that: 1) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations. 2) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress after tumor embolization when post-embolization ischemia is expected to induce painful stimuli and systemic distress. 3) The beneficial effect of self-hypnotic coping skills acquired during an invasive procedure carries over to the next invasive procedure. Upon completion, the efficacy and durability of procedural administration of nonpharmacologic analgesia will be known by a rigorous and practical assessment. The relative performance of self-hypnotic relaxation will be quantified compared to standard care and empathic controls in a well-characterized population of patients within the controlled and monitored environment of a busy interventional radiology practice. Results from this competing renewal will provide the next level of data needed for future study design to determine broad clinical utility in a multicenter randomized controlled trial."

It is very small, similar to a beeper, and is connected to the patient through a small plastic catheter subcutaneously. This measures blood sugar every five minutes for a total of 288 readings a day with minimum discomfort. The hypothesis of this study is that use of the Minimed glucose monitor will provide information about variations of blood sugar in gestational diabetics that is missed by capillary glucose monitors.~Our conclusions will allow us to compare blood glucose trends among the groups. After the data is analyzed in this pilot study, we plan to design a bigger study involving more subjects to study the impact of the blood sugar variations in the outcome of the newborn, and to obtain generalizable results for the population in general."

Recent studies have shown that fluoxetine-a drug commonly used to treat depression and panic disorder-can decrease acts of aggression.~Men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who have a history of inflicting physical aggression on a spouses or significant others in the past year (with at least one episode occurring not under the influence of alcohol) may be eligible for this study. Participants spouses or significant others will also be asked to participate. All potential participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation and history, breath alcohol analysis, blood tests, urine drug screen and electrocardiogram.~Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures:~Perpetrator~Interview and questionnaires - Participants will be interviewed by a social worker about past and current mental health and use of alcohol and illicit drugs and will complete questionnaires assessing emotional state and personality, depression, anxiety, aggression and alcohol consumption. Some of the questionnaires will be repeated at monthly intervals.~Physical performance testing - Performance and speed will be measured in three separate training sessions that involve repeatedly pressing a button on a button box console, earning points worth money.~Dyadic interaction paradigm - Participants will interact with their spouse/significant other in a small room, first discussing a neutral topic, such as the day's events, and then a subject that has been a source of conflict.~Fluoxetine administration - Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg. of fluoxetine or placebo (identical capsules with no active ingredients) once a day for 3 days, then twice a day, increasing up to four capsules a day if there are no serious side effects. Blood will be drawn once a month to measure drug levels. At the end of 3 months, participants taking placebo may remain in the study and receive fluoxetine.~Clinic visits - Participants are followed in the clinic weekly for the first month, then twice a month for the next 2 months for adjustment of number of pills, evaluation of aggressive behavior and alcohol consumption, and therapy for issues of self-esteem, anger management and communication skills. Couples therapy aimed at conflict resolution and improving communication skills will be offered.~Genetic tests (optional) - Blood will be drawn to determine if there is a relationship between genes involved in a chemical process (serotonin reuptake) that is influenced by fluoxetine and the participant's response to the drug.~Spouse/Significant other:~Spouses/significant others will complete several questionnaires once a month (total 4 times) to rate their partners' behavior while in the study. They will also participate in the dyadic interaction paradigm described above at the beginning and end of the study."

Several studies support the role for specialists and their specific knowledge and expertise in a variety of disorders including diabetes. A variety of methods have been designed to optimize the use of specialty expertise including practice guidelines and disease management approaches as well as the consultation/referral process. The referral-consultation process is an important mechanism for obtaining clinically useful information. At one end of the spectrum of this process, informal consultation involves discussion about a patient with a colleague without the consultant seeing the patient; at the other end of the spectrum, care of the patient is transferred to another physician and the process is formalized. Because much specialist expertise resides in the specialists themselves, the expansion of primary care sites to include community-based outpatient clinics has implications for access to the specialists located elsewhere. This study was designed to evaluate a computer-assisted voice mail system which is relatively inexpensive and more convenient than video-telemedicine systems, making it more practical and more easily exportable. Diabetes care delivery was chosen as the model in which to assess informal consultation based on its frequency among veterans, management challenges, and the emphasis on improvement in diabetes care in VA. A secondary goal of the project was to better characterize the consultation process."

This study will also examine reduction of smoking among non-quitters and maintenance of smoking cessation through 6 weeks postpartum among women who quit.~Prenatal smoking is the leading preventable cause of low birth weight in the US. Reduction in smoking during pregnancy could result in significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes and reducing the cost of health care. There is evidence that low-intensity pregnancy smoking cessation programs may be inadequate for women who are more addicted, and at educational and economic disadvantage. Motivational enhancement strategies have shown considerable promise in the treatment of addictive behaviors. Physiological feedback highlighting prenatal effects of smoking and benefits of cessation has been found to enhance prenatal smoking cessation counseling. An intervention that combines motivational enhancement counseling and physiological feedback may have powerful effects beyond low-intensity interventions or usual counseling."

        "brief_summary": "This research study is designed to find out if increasing the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fats improves concentration, motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. These polyunsaturated fats may also change the chemicals in the brain that control these responses. Specifically, these polyunsaturated fats may raise brain levels of neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin. Polyunsaturated fats are important for improving the function of both the brain and the heart. People cannot make these polyunsaturated fats and they can only be obtained from the oils that we eat. For three months subjects will take 8 capsules a day that contain either corn oils flavored with fish oils or fish oil that taste a little like corn oils. Subjects will not be told which oils we expect to work better. An initial evaluation will determine if subjects fit the criteria necessary to enter the study. A battery of tests will be conducted twice, once before starting the capsules and again after three months of taking the capsules. These batteries of tests will include an MRI of the head, paper and pencil tests to evaluate changes in mood, and tests of concentration and motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. Two lumbar punctures will be performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid so that changes in neurotransmitters can be evaluated. Subjects will be on a no seafood diet to equalize their dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Subjects will be expected to complete all parts of this study."

This is a basic research study, conducted using normal human donors, of mechanisms involved in hematotoxicity and of the protective response of human hematopoietic progenitor cells to hematotoxic agents. Tumor necrosis factor exposure protects these cells from a subsequent exposure to hematotoxic agents. The alteration of gene expression in these cells caused by tumor necrosis factor is being studied. Additionally, the tumor necrosis factor-induced biochemical pathways involved in protection of human hematopoietic progenitor cells will be studied."

        "brief_summary": "This study will investigate the effects of the drug flumazenil on brain excitability and the drug's relationship to a natural brain chemical called GABA. Flumazenil is commonly used in hospitals to reverse the effects of a group of drugs called benzodiazepines, one of which is Valium. Benzodiazepines act by enhancing the effects of GABA.~Healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.~Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) four times on two different days, before and after receiving an intravenous (through a vein) infusion of either flumazenil or placebo (an inactive sugar solution), as follows:~TMS study 1~Drug or placebo infusion~TMS study 2 - 15 minutes after infusion~TMS study 3 - 60 minutes after infusion~TMS study 4 - 120 minutes after infusion~In transcranial magnetic stimulation, a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. These currents stimulate the cortex (outer part of the brain). They may cause muscle, hand, or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or they may affect other reflexes or movements. During the study, subjects may be asked to make movements, do simple tasks or tense muscles. To record the electrical activity of muscles, electrodes will be taped to the skin over the muscles tested. In some cases, the studies will be videotaped.~Flumazenil will be infused through a catheter (thin plastic tube) attached to a needle placed in an arm vein. On one day, subjects will receive a 1-mg injection of flumazenil followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg of the drug for about 30 minutes. On the other day, they will receive placebo, administered in the same manner."
